abstract = {High-throughput single-cell transcriptomics offers an unbiased approach for understanding the extent, basis and function of gene expression variation between seemingly identical cells. Here we sequence single-cell {RNA}-seq libraries prepared from over 1,700 primary mouse bone-marrow-derived dendritic cells spanning several experimental conditions. We find substantial variation between identically stimulated dendritic cells, in both the fraction of cells detectably expressing a given messenger {RNA} and the transcript's level within expressing cells. Distinct gene modules are characterized by different temporal heterogeneity profiles. In particular, a 'core' module of antiviral genes is expressed very early by a few 'precocious' cells in response to uniform stimulation with a pathogenic component, but is later activated in all cells. By stimulating cells individually in sealed microfluidic chambers, analysing dendritic cells from knockout mice, and modulating secretion and extracellular signalling, we show that this response is coordinated by interferon-mediated paracrine signalling from these precocious cells. Notably, preventing cell-to-cell communication also substantially reduces variability between cells in the expression of an early-induced 'peaked' inflammatory module, suggesting that paracrine signalling additionally represses part of the inflammatory program. Our study highlights the importance of cell-to-cell communication in controlling cellular heterogeneity and reveals general strategies that multicellular populations can use to establish complex dynamic responses.}

However, under certain conditions, only a small amount of material is available, which requires more sensitive techniques that can preferably be used at the single-cell level. Here we describe a single-cell digital gene expression profiling assay. Using our {mRNA}-Seq assay with only a single mouse blastomere, we detected the expression of 75\% (5,270) more genes than microarray techniques and identified 1,753 previously unknown splice junctions called by at least 5 reads. Moreover, 8-19\% of the genes with multiple known transcript isoforms expressed at least two isoforms in the same blastomere or oocyte, which unambiguously demonstrated the complexity of the transcript variants at whole-genome scale in individual cells. Finally, for Dicer1(-/-) and Ago2(-/-) (Eif2c2(-/-)) oocytes, we found that 1,696 and 1,553 genes, respectively, were abnormally upregulated compared to wild-type controls, with 619 genes in common.}

Here we report that mature naive {CD8}(+) T cells lacking the transcription factor Foxp1 gained effector phenotype and function and proliferated directly in response to interleukin 7 ({IL}-7) in vitro. Foxp1 repressed expression of the {IL}-7 receptor \alpha-chain ({IL}-{7R\alpha}) by antagonizing Foxo1 and negatively regulated signaling by the kinases {MEK} and Erk. Acute deletion of Foxp1 induced naive T cells to gain an effector phenotype and proliferate in lympho-replete mice. Foxp1-deficient naive {CD8}(+) T cells proliferated even in lymphopenic mice deficient in major histocompatibility complex class I. Our results demonstrate that Foxp1 exerts essential cell-intrinsic regulation of naive T cell quiescence, providing direct evidence that lymphocyte quiescence is achieved through actively maintained mechanisms that include transcriptional regulation.}

A sample describes the set of molecules that are being probed and references a single platform used to generate its molecular abundance data. A series organizes samples into the meaningful data sets which make up an experiment. The {GEO} repository is publicly accessible through the World Wide Web at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo.}

In addition to unbiased de novo detection of canonical junctions, {STAR} can discover non-canonical splices and chimeric (fusion) transcripts, and is also capable of mapping full-length {RNA} sequences. Using Roche 454 sequencing of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction amplicons, we experimentally validated 1960 novel intergenic splice junctions with an 80-90\% success rate, corroborating the high precision of the {STAR} mapping strategy. {AVAILABILITY} {AND} {IMPLEMENTATION}: {STAR} is implemented as a standalone C++ code. {STAR} is free open source software distributed under {GPLv3} license and can be downloaded from http://code.google.com/p/rna-star/.}

Liver samples from morbidly obese patients (n = 45) with all stages of {NAFLD} and controls (n = 18) were analyzed by array-based {DNA} methylation and {mRNA} expression profiling. {NAFLD}-specific expression and methylation differences were seen for nine genes coding for key enzymes in intermediate metabolism (including {PC}, {ACLY}, and {PLCG1}) and insulin/insulin-like signaling (including {IGF1}, {IGFBP2}, and {PRKCE}) and replicated by bisulfite pyrosequening (independent n = 39). Transcription factor binding sites at {NAFLD}-specific {CpG} sites were \textgreater1,000-fold enriched for {ZNF274}, {PGC1A}, and {SREBP2}. Intraindividual comparison of liver biopsies before and after bariatric surgery showed {NAFLD}-associated methylation changes to be partially reversible. Postbariatric and {NAFLD}-specific methylation signatures were clearly distinct both in gene ontology and transcription factor binding site analyses, with \textgreater400-fold enrichment of {NRF1}, {HSF1}, and {ESRRA} sites.

abstract = {Adult stem cells are crucial for physiological tissue renewal and regeneration after injury. Prevailing models assume the existence of a single quiescent population of stem cells residing in a specialized niche of a given tissue. Emerging evidence indicates that both quiescent (out of cell cycle and in a lower metabolic state) and active (in cell cycle and not able to retain {DNA} labels) stem cell subpopulations may coexist in several tissues, in separate yet adjoining locations. Here, we summarize these findings and propose that quiescent and active stem cell populations have separate but cooperative functional roles.}

Examples of such diseases include cancer, diabetes, as well as neurodegenerative and infectious diseases. So far, the explosion of information in the fields of genomics and proteomics has not been matched by a corresponding advancement of knowledge in the field of lipids, which is largely due to the complexity of lipids and the lack of powerful tools for their analysis. Novel analytical approaches--in particular, liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry--for systems-level analysis of lipids and their interacting partners (lipidomics) now make this field a promising area of biomedical research, with a variety of applications in drug and biomarker development.}

abstract = {limma is an R/Bioconductor software package that provides an integrated solution for analysing data from gene expression experiments. It contains rich features for handling complex experimental designs and for information borrowing to overcome the problem of small sample sizes. Over the past decade, limma has been a popular choice for gene discovery through differential expression analyses of microarray and high-throughput {PCR} data. The package contains particularly strong facilities for reading, normalizing and exploring such data. Recently, the capabilities of limma have been significantly expanded in two important directions. First, the package can now perform both differential expression and differential splicing analyses of {RNA} sequencing ({RNA}-seq) data. All the downstream analysis tools previously restricted to microarray data are now available for {RNA}-seq as well. These capabilities allow users to analyse both {RNA}-seq and microarray data with very similar pipelines. Second, the package is now able to go past the traditional gene-wise expression analyses in a variety of ways, analysing expression profiles in terms of co-regulated sets of genes or in terms of higher-order expression signatures. This provides enhanced possibilities for biological interpretation of gene expression differences. This article reviews the philosophy and design of the limma package, summarizing both new and historical features, with an emphasis on recent enhancements and features that have not been previously described. \copyright The Author(s) 2015.

A statistical approach using various models is universally used to identify the most relevant pathways in a given experiment. Here, we show that the existing pathway analysis methods fail to take into consideration important biological aspects and may provide incorrect results in certain situations. By using a systems biology approach, we developed an impact analysis that includes the classical statistics but also considers other crucial factors such as the magnitude of each gene's expression change, their type and position in the given pathways, their interactions, etc. The impact analysis is an attempt to a deeper level of statistical analysis, informed by more pathway-specific biology than the existing techniques. On several illustrative data sets, the classical analysis produces both false positives and false negatives, while the impact analysis provides biologically meaningful results.

Although the identification of specific oncogenes has led to the development of clinically effective, molecularly targeted therapies in some cases, {KRAS} has remained refractory to this approach. A complementary strategy for targeting {KRAS} is to identify gene products that, when inhibited, result in cell death only in the presence of an oncogenic allele. Here we have used systematic {RNA} interference to detect synthetic lethal partners of oncogenic {KRAS} and found that the non-canonical {IkappaB} kinase {TBK1} was selectively essential in cells that contain mutant {KRAS}. Suppression of {TBK1} induced apoptosis specifically in human cancer cell lines that depend on oncogenic {KRAS} expression. In these cells, {TBK1} activated {NF}-{kappaB} anti-apoptotic signals involving c-Rel and {BCL}-{XL} (also known as {BCL2L1}) that were essential for survival, providing mechanistic insights into this synthetic lethal interaction. These observations indicate that {TBK1} and {NF}-{kappaB} signalling are essential in {KRAS} mutant tumours, and establish a general approach for the rational identification of co-dependent pathways in cancer.}

Causal networks constructed from individual relationships curated from the literature are particularly suited for this task, since they create mechanistic hypotheses that explain the expression changes observed in datasets. {RESULTS}: We present and discuss a suite of algorithms and tools for inferring and scoring regulator networks upstream of gene-expression data based on a large-scale causal network derived from the Ingenuity Knowledge Base.

abstract = {To identify regulatory drivers of prostate cancer malignancy, we have assembled genome-wide regulatory networks (interactomes) for human and mouse prostate cancer from expression profiles of human tumors and of genetically engineered mouse models, respectively. Cross-species computational analysis of these interactomes has identified {FOXM1} and {CENPF} as synergistic master regulators of prostate cancer malignancy. Experimental validation shows that {FOXM1} and {CENPF} function synergistically to promote tumor growth by coordinated regulation of target gene expression and activation of key signaling pathways associated with prostate cancer malignancy. Furthermore, co-expression of {FOXM1} and {CENPF} is a robust prognostic indicator of poor survival and metastasis. Thus, genome-wide cross-species interrogation of regulatory networks represents a valuable strategy to identify causal mechanisms of human cancer. Copyright \copyright 2014 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {The advent of microarray technology has made it possible to classify disease states based on gene expression profiles of patients. Typically, marker genes are selected by measuring the power of their expression profiles to discriminate among patients of different disease states. However, expression-based classification can be challenging in complex diseases due to factors such as cellular heterogeneity within a tissue sample and genetic heterogeneity across patients. A promising technique for coping with these challenges is to incorporate pathway information into the disease classification procedure in order to classify disease based on the activity of entire signaling pathways or protein complexes rather than on the expression levels of individual genes or proteins. We propose a new classification method based on pathway activities inferred for each patient. For each pathway, an activity level is summarized from the gene expression levels of its condition-responsive genes ({CORGs}), defined as the subset of genes in the pathway whose combined expression delivers optimal discriminative power for the disease phenotype. We show that classifiers using pathway activity achieve better performance than classifiers based on individual gene expression, for both simple and complex case-control studies including differentiation of perturbed from non-perturbed cells and subtyping of several different kinds of cancer. Moreover, the new method outperforms several previous approaches that use a static (i.e., non-conditional) definition of pathways. Within a pathway, the identified {CORGs} may facilitate the development of better diagnostic markers and the discovery of core alterations in human disease.}

abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Publicly available data repositories facilitate the sharing of an ever-increasing amount of microarray data. However, these datasets remain highly underutilized. Reutilizing the data could offer insights into questions and diseases entirely distinct from those considered in the original experimental design. {METHODS}: We first analyzed microarray datasets derived from known perturbations of specific pathways using the samr package in R to identify specific patterns of change in gene expression. We refer to these pattern of gene expression alteration as a "pathway signatures." We then used Spearman's rank correlation coefficient, a non-parametric measure of correlation, to determine similarities between pathway signatures and disease profiles, and permutation analysis to evaluate false discovery rate. This enabled detection of statistically significant similarity between these pathway signatures and corresponding changes observed in human disease. Finally, we evaluated pathway activation, as indicated by correlation with the pathway signature, as a risk factor for poor prognosis using multiple unrelated, publicly available datasets. {RESULTS}: We have developed a novel method, Expression-based Pathway Signature Analysis ({EPSA}). We demonstrate that {ESPA} is a rigorous computational approach for statistically evaluating the degree of similarity between highly disparate sources of microarray expression data. We also show how {EPSA} can be used in a number of cases to stratify patients with differential disease prognosis. {EPSA} can be applied to many different types of datasets in spite of different platforms, different experimental designs, and different species. Applying this method can yield new insights into human disease progression. {CONCLUSION}: {EPSA} enables the use of publicly available data for an entirely new, translational purpose to enable the identification of potential pathways of dysregulation in human disease, as well as potential leads for therapeutic molecular targets.}

abstract = {{MOTIVATION}: Gene expression class comparison studies may identify hundreds or thousands of genes as differentially expressed ({DE}) between sample groups. Gaining biological insight from the result of such experiments can be approached, for instance, by identifying the signaling pathways impacted by the observed changes. Most of the existing pathway analysis methods focus on either the number of {DE} genes observed in a given pathway (enrichment analysis methods), or on the correlation between the pathway genes and the class of the samples (functional class scoring methods). Both approaches treat the pathways as simple sets of genes, disregarding the complex gene interactions that these pathways are built to describe. {RESULTS}: We describe a novel signaling pathway impact analysis ({SPIA}) that combines the evidence obtained from the classical enrichment analysis with a novel type of evidence, which measures the actual perturbation on a given pathway under a given condition. A bootstrap procedure is used to assess the significance of the observed total pathway perturbation. Using simulations we show that the evidence derived from perturbations is independent of the pathway enrichment evidence. This allows us to calculate a global pathway significance P-value, which combines the enrichment and perturbation P-values. We illustrate the capabilities of the novel method on four real datasets. The results obtained on these data show that {SPIA} has better specificity and more sensitivity than several widely used pathway analysis methods. {AVAILABILITY}: {SPIA} was implemented as an R package available at http://vortex.cs.wayne.edu/ontoexpress/}

An overdispersed Poisson model is used to account for both biological and technical variability. Empirical Bayes methods are used to moderate the degree of overdispersion across transcripts, improving the reliability of inference. The methodology can be used even with the most minimal levels of replication, provided at least one phenotype or experimental condition is replicated. The software may have other applications beyond sequencing data, such as proteome peptide count data. {AVAILABILITY}: The package is freely available under the {LGPL} licence from the Bioconductor web site (http://bioconductor.org).}

The most viable current approach to this problem consists of determining whether sets of genes are connected by some common theme, e.g. genes from the same pathway are overrepresented among those whose differential expression in response to a perturbation is most pronounced. There are many approaches to this problem, and the results they produce show a fair amount of dispersion, but they all fall within a common framework consisting of a few basic components.

In contrast to other reports, our analyses focused on the difference, rather than similarity, between {RNA}-Seq and microarray technologies in transcriptome profiling. A comparison of data sets derived from {RNA}-Seq and Affymetrix platforms using the same set of samples showed a high correlation between gene expression profiles generated by the two platforms. However, it also demonstrated that {RNA}-Seq was superior in detecting low abundance transcripts, differentiating biologically critical isoforms, and allowing the identification of genetic variants. {RNA}-Seq also demonstrated a broader dynamic range than microarray, which allowed for the detection of more differentially expressed genes with higher fold-change. Analysis of the two datasets also showed the benefit derived from avoidance of technical issues inherent to microarray probe performance such as cross-hybridization, non-specific hybridization and limited detection range of individual probes. Because {RNA}-Seq does not rely on a pre-designed complement sequence detection probe, it is devoid of issues associated with probe redundancy and annotation, which simplified interpretation of the data. Despite the superior benefits of {RNA}-Seq, microarrays are still the more common choice of researchers when conducting transcriptional profiling experiments. This is likely because {RNA}-Seq sequencing technology is new to most researchers, more expensive than microarray, data storage is more challenging and analysis is more complex. We expect that once these barriers are overcome, the {RNA}-Seq platform will become the predominant tool for transcriptome analysis.}

Existing computational methods for the genome-wide "reverse engineering" of such networks have been successful only for lower eukaryotes with simple genomes. Here we present {ARACNE}, a novel algorithm, using microarray expression profiles, specifically designed to scale up to the complexity of regulatory networks in mammalian cells, yet general enough to address a wider range of network deconvolution problems. This method uses an information theoretic approach to eliminate the majority of indirect interactions inferred by co-expression methods. {RESULTS}: We prove that {ARACNE} reconstructs the network exactly (asymptotically) if the effect of loops in the network topology is negligible, and we show that the algorithm works well in practice, even in the presence of numerous loops and complex topologies. We assess {ARACNE}'s ability to reconstruct transcriptional regulatory networks using both a realistic synthetic dataset and a microarray dataset from human B cells. On synthetic datasets {ARACNE} achieves very low error rates and outperforms established methods, such as Relevance Networks and Bayesian Networks. Application to the deconvolution of genetic networks in human B cells demonstrates {ARACNE}'s ability to infer validated transcriptional targets of the {cMYC} proto-oncogene. We also study the effects of misestimation of mutual information on network reconstruction, and show that algorithms based on mutual information ranking are more resilient to estimation errors. {CONCLUSION}: {ARACNE} shows promise in identifying direct transcriptional interactions in mammalian cellular networks, a problem that has challenged existing reverse engineering algorithms. This approach should enhance our ability to use microarray data to elucidate functional mechanisms that underlie cellular processes and to identify molecular targets of pharmacological compounds in mammalian cellular networks.}

However, when dealing with highly skewed datasets, Precision-Recall ({PR}) curves give a more informative picture of an algorithm's performance. We show that a deep connection exists between {ROC} space and {PR} space, such that a curve dominates in {ROC} space if and only if it dominates in {PR} space. A corollary is the notion of an achievable {PR} curve, which has properties much like the convex hull in {ROC} space; we show an efficient algorithm for computing this curve. Finally, we also note differences in the two types of curves are significant for algorithm design. For example, in {PR} space it is incorrect to linearly interpolate between points. Furthermore, algorithms that optimize the area under the {ROC} curve are not guaranteed to optimize the area under the {PR} curve.},

abstract = {The Spi1/Pu.1 transcription factor plays a crucial role in myeloid cell development in vertebrates. Despite extensive studies of Spi1, the controlled gene group remains largely unknown. To identify genes dependent on Spi1, we used a microarray strategy using a knockdown approach in zebrafish embryos combined with fluorescence-activated cell sorting of myeloid cells from transgenic embryos. This approach of using knockdowns with specific green fluorescent protein-marked cell types was highly successful in identifying macrophagespecific genes in Spi1-directed innate immunity. We found a gene group downregulated on spi1 knockdown, which is also enriched in fluorescence-activated cell-sorted embryonic myeloid cells of a spi1:{GFP} transgenic line. This gene group, representing putative myeloidspecific Spi1 target genes, contained all 5 previously identified Spi1-dependent zebrafish genes as well as a large set of novel immune-related genes. Colocalization studies with neutrophil and macrophage markers revealed that genes cxcr3.2, mpeg1, ptpn6, and mfap4 were expressed specifically in early embryonic macrophages. In a functional approach, we demonstrated that gene cxcr3.2, coding for chemokine receptor 3.2, is involved in macrophage migration to the site of bacterial infection. Therefore, based on our combined transcriptome analyses, we discovered novel early macrophage-specific marker genes, including a signal transducer pivotal for macrophage migration in the innate immune response.}

abstract = {{UNLABELLED}: The cellular basis of liver regeneration has been intensely investigated for many years. However, the mechanisms initiating hepatocyte "plasticity" and priming for proliferation are not yet fully clear. We investigated alterations in gene expression patterns during the first 72 hours of {C57BL}/{6N} mouse hepatocyte culture on collagen monolayers ({CM}), which display a high basal frequency of proliferation in the absence of cytokines. Although many metabolic genes were down-regulated, genes related to mitogen-activated protein kinase ({MAPK}) signaling and cell cycle were up-regulated. The latter genes showed an overrepresentation of transcription factor binding sites ({TFBS}) for {ETF} ({TEA} domain family member 2), {E2F1} ({E2F} transcription factor 1), and {SP}-1 (Sp1 transcription factor) (P \textless 0.001), all depending on {MAPK} signaling. Time-dependent increase of {ERK1}/2 phosphorylation occurred during the first 48 hours (and beyond) in the absence of cytokines, accompanied by an enhanced bromodeoxyuridine labeling index of 20\%. The {MEK} inhibitor {PD98059} blunted these effects indicating {MAPK} signaling as major trigger for this cytokine-independent proliferative response. In line with these in vitro findings, liver tissue of mice challenged with {CCl}(4) displayed hepatocytes with intense p-{ERK1}/2 staining and nuclear {SP}-1 and {E2F1} expression. Furthermore, differentially expressed genes in mice after partial hepatectomy contained overrepresented {TFBS} for {ETF}, {E2F1}, and {SP}-1 and displayed increased expression of {E2F1}. {CONCLUSION}: Cultivation of murine hepatocytes on {CM} primes cells for proliferation through cytokine-independent activation of {MAPK} signaling. The transcription factors {ETF}, {E2F1}, and {SP}-1 seem to play a pronounced role in mediating proliferation-dependent differential gene expression. Similar events, but on a shorter time-scale, occur very early after liver damage in vivo. Copyright \copyright 2010 American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.}

abstract = {The ability of hepatocytes to enter the cell cycle and regenerate the liver after tissue loss provides an in vivo model to study the regulation of proliferation and organ regeneration. The extent of hepatocyte proliferation is directly proportional to the amount of resected liver tissue, and 2/3 partial hepatectomy (2/3 {PH}) leads to highly synchronized hepatocyte cell-cycle entry and progression. This surgical technique was first described in rats and requires modification for application in mice. Lack of standardization of 2/3 {PH} in mice has caused discrepancies in the results obtained in different laboratories. Here, we provide a protocol and a movie describing a straightforward surgical technique, which takes 15-20 min, to consistently remove two-thirds of the liver in mice. As this protocol is not associated with mortality and gives highly reproducible results, we hope that it will be widely used and serve to standardize 2/3 {PH} in mice.}

Here we use a novel epigenetic biomarker of aging (referred to as an "epigenetic clock") to study the relationship between high body mass index ({BMI}) and the {DNA} methylation ages of human blood, liver, muscle, and adipose tissue. A significant correlation between {BMI} and epigenetic age acceleration could only be observed for liver (r = 0.42, P = 6.8 × 10(-4) in dataset 1 and r = 0.42, P = 1.2 × 10(-4) in dataset 2). On average, epigenetic age increased by 3.3 y for each 10 {BMI} units. The detected age acceleration in liver is not associated with the Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease Activity Score or any of its component traits after adjustment for {BMI}. The 279 genes that are underexpressed in older liver samples are highly enriched (1.2 × 10(-9)) with nuclear mitochondrial genes that play a role in oxidative phosphorylation and electron transport. The epigenetic age acceleration, which is not reversible in the short term after rapid weight loss induced by bariatric surgery, may play a role in liver-related comorbidities of obesity, such as insulin resistance and liver cancer.}

abstract = {The ability to quantitatively survey the global behavior of transcriptomes has been a key milestone in the field of systems biology, enabled by the advent of {DNA} microarrays. While this approach has literally transformed our vision and approach to cellular physiology, microarray technology has always been limited by the requirement to decide, a priori, what regions of the genome to examine. While very high density tiling arrays have reduced this limitation for simpler organisms, it remains an obstacle for larger, more complex, eukaryotic genomes. The recent development of "next-generation" massively parallel sequencing ({MPS}) technologies by companies such as Roche (454 {GS} {FLX}), Illumina (Genome Analyzer {II}), and {ABI} ({AB} {SOLiD}) has completely transformed the way in which quantitative transcriptomics can be done. These new technologies have reduced both the cost-per-reaction and time required by orders of magnitude, making the use of sequencing a cost-effective option for many experimental approaches. One such method that has recently been developed uses {MPS} technology to directly survey the {RNA} content of cells, without requiring any of the traditional cloning associated with {EST} sequencing. This approach, called "{RNA}-seq", can generate quantitative expression scores that are comparable to microarrays, with the added benefit that the entire transcriptome is surveyed without the requirement of a priori knowledge of transcribed regions. The important advantage of this technique is that not only can quantitative expression measures be made, but transcript structures including alternatively spliced transcript isoforms, can also be identified. This article discusses the experimental approach for both sample preparation and data analysis for the technique of {RNA}-seq.}

A multi-organ approach was recently suggested to identify the core and regulatory pathways in fibrosis, with the aim of integrating the wealth of information emerging from basic fibrosis research. In this Review, we focus on recent advances in liver fibrosis research as a paradigm for wound healing in solid organs and the role of the immune system in regulating and balancing this response.}

abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Gene set enrichment ({GSE}) analysis is a popular framework for condensing information from gene expression profiles into a pathway or signature summary. The strengths of this approach over single gene analysis include noise and dimension reduction, as well as greater biological interpretability. As molecular profiling experiments move beyond simple case-control studies, robust and flexible {GSE} methodologies are needed that can model pathway activity within highly heterogeneous data sets. {RESULTS}: To address this challenge, we introduce Gene Set Variation Analysis ({GSVA}), a {GSE} method that estimates variation of pathway activity over a sample population in an unsupervised manner. We demonstrate the robustness of {GSVA} in a comparison with current state of the art sample-wise enrichment methods. Further, we provide examples of its utility in differential pathway activity and survival analysis. Lastly, we show how {GSVA} works analogously with data from both microarray and {RNA}-seq experiments. {CONCLUSIONS}: {GSVA} provides increased power to detect subtle pathway activity changes over a sample population in comparison to corresponding methods. While {GSE} methods are generally regarded as end points of a bioinformatic analysis, {GSVA} constitutes a starting point to build pathway-centric models of biology. Moreover, {GSVA} contributes to the current need of {GSE} methods for {RNA}-seq data. {GSVA} is an open source software package for R which forms part of the Bioconductor project and can be downloaded at http://www.bioconductor.org.}

abstract = {Gene set analysis ({GSA}) is used to elucidate genome-wide data, in particular transcriptome data. A multitude of methods have been proposed for this step of the analysis, and many of them have been compared and evaluated. Unfortunately, there is no consolidated opinion regarding what methods should be preferred, and the variety of available {GSA} software and implementations pose a difficulty for the end-user who wants to try out different methods. To address this, we have developed the R package Piano that collects a range of {GSA} methods into the same system, for the benefit of the end-user. Further on we refine the {GSA} workflow by using modifications of the gene-level statistics. This enables us to divide the resulting gene set P-values into three classes, describing different aspects of gene expression directionality at gene set level. We use our fully implemented workflow to investigate the impact of the individual components of {GSA} by using microarray and {RNA}-seq data. The results show that the evaluated methods are globally similar and the major separation correlates well with our defined directionality classes. As a consequence of this, we suggest to use a consensus scoring approach, based on multiple {GSA} runs. In combination with the directionality classes, this constitutes a more thorough basis for an enriched biological interpretation.}

abstract = {When biochemical studies on the liver are interpreted, the cells of the sinusoidal area frequently receive little attention because, compared to hepatocytes, their contribution to subcellular fractions is assumed insignificant. A systematic stereological analysis of liver parenchyma was therefore performed in order to determine the distribution of organelles and membranes between hepatocytic and nonhepatocytic cells, namely endothelial, Kupffer, and fat-storing cells. The livers were fixed by vascular perfusion and the data were corrected for systematic errors dur to section thickness and compression. The extracellular space compartment includes the lumina of sinusoids (10.6\%), the space of Disse (4.9\%), and the bile canaliculi (0.4\%). Hepatocytes constitute 78\% of parenchymal volume; the nonhepatocytes account for 6.3\% and consist of 2.8\% endothelial cells, 2.1\% Kupffer cells, and 1.4\% fat-storing cells. The nonhepatocytes contribute 55\% of the volume of lipid droplets in the liver, 43\% of the lysosomes, and 1.2\% of the mitochondria. Although the nonhepatocytes account for only 8\% of the total surface area of parenchymal membranes, they contain 26.5\% of all the plasma membranes, 32.4\% of the lysosomal membranes, 15.1\% of the Golgi apparatus 6.4\% of the endoplasmic reticulum, and 2.4\% of the mitochondrial membranes. The data demonstrate the extent to which nonhepatocytic organelles can potentially contaminate subcellular fractions used for biochemical studies. Particularly important for the interpretation of studies on lysosomes, plasma membrane, and Golgi apparatus is the finding that an appreciable part of these organelles may be derived from cell types other than hepatocytes.}

We used {VIPER} to evaluate the functional relevance of genetic alterations in regulatory proteins across all samples in The Cancer Genome Atlas ({TCGA}). In addition to accurately infer aberrant protein activity induced by established mutations, we also identified a fraction of tumors with aberrant activity of druggable oncoproteins despite a lack of mutations, and vice versa. In vitro assays confirmed that {VIPER}-inferred protein activity outperformed mutational analysis in predicting sensitivity to targeted inhibitors.}

More than 80\% of all time series expression datasets are short (8 time points or fewer). These datasets present unique challenges.

Most clustering algorithms are unable to distinguish between real and random patterns. {RESULTS}: We present an algorithm specifically designed for clustering short time series expression data. Our algorithm works by assigning genes to a predefined set of model profiles that capture the potential distinct patterns that can be expected from the experiment. We discuss how to obtain such a set of profiles and how to determine the significance of each of these profiles. Significant profiles are retained for further analysis and can be combined to form clusters. We tested our method on both simulated and real biological data. Using immune response data we show that our algorithm can correctly detect the temporal profile of relevant functional categories. Using Gene Ontology analysis we show that our algorithm outperforms both general clustering algorithms and algorithms designed specifically for clustering time series gene expression data. {AVAILABILITY}: Information on obtaining a Java implementation with a graphical user interface ({GUI}) is available from http://www.cs.cmu.edu/\~jernst/st/ {SUPPLEMENTARY} {INFORMATION}: Available at http://www.cs.cmu.edu/\~jernst/st/}

abstract = {Bile is a unique and vital aqueous secretion of the liver that is formed by the hepatocyte and modified down stream by absorptive and secretory properties of the bile duct epithelium. Approximately 5\% of bile consists of organic and inorganic solutes of considerable complexity. The bile-secretory unit consists of a canalicular network which is formed by the apical membrane of adjacent hepatocytes and sealed by tight junctions. The bile canaliculi (∼1 μm in diameter) conduct the flow of bile countercurrent to the direction of portal blood flow and connect with the canal of Hering and bile ducts which progressively increase in diameter and complexity prior to the entry of bile into the gallbladder, common bile duct, and intestine. Canalicular bile secretion is determined by both bile salt-dependent and independent transport systems which are localized at the apical membrane of the hepatocyte and largely consist of a series of adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette transport proteins that function as export pumps for bile salts and other organic solutes. These transporters create osmotic gradients within the bile canalicular lumen that provide the driving force for movement of fluid into the lumen via aquaporins. Species vary with respect to the relative amounts of bile salt-dependent and independent canalicular flow and cholangiocyte secretion which is highly regulated by hormones, second messengers, and signal transduction pathways. Most determinants of bile secretion are now characterized at the molecular level in animal models and in man. Genetic mutations serve to illuminate many of their functions. \copyright 2013 American Physiological Society.}

abstract = {Single-cell {RNA} sequencing ({scRNA}-seq) is widely used to profile the transcriptome of individual cells. This provides biological resolution that cannot be matched by bulk {RNA} sequencing, at the cost of increased technical noise and data complexity. The differences between {scRNA}-seq and bulk {RNA}-seq data mean that the analysis of the former cannot be performed by recycling bioinformatics pipelines for the latter. Rather, dedicated single-cell methods are required at various steps to exploit the cellular resolution while accounting for technical noise. This article describes a computational workflow for low-level analyses of {scRNA}-seq data, based primarily on software packages from the open-source Bioconductor project. It covers basic steps including quality control, data exploration and normalization, as well as more complex procedures such as cell cycle phase assignment, identification of highly variable and correlated genes, clustering into subpopulations and marker gene detection. Analyses were demonstrated on gene-level count data from several publicly available datasets involving haematopoietic stem cells, brain-derived cells, T-helper cells and mouse embryonic stem cells.

abstract = {Differential {mRNA} expression studies implicitly assume that changes in {mRNA} expression have biological meaning, most likely mediated by corresponding changes in protein levels. Yet studies into {mRNA}-protein correspondence have shown notoriously poor correlation between {mRNA} and protein expression levels, creating concern for inferences from only {mRNA} expression data. However, none of these studies have examined in particular differentially expressed {mRNA}. Here, we examined this question in an ovarian cancer xenograft model. We measured protein and {mRNA} expression for twenty-nine genes in four drug-treatment conditions and in untreated controls. We identified {mRNAs} differentially expressed between drug-treated xenografts and controls, then analysed {mRNA}-protein expression correlation across a five-point time-course within each of the four experimental conditions. We evaluated correlations between {mRNAs} and their protein products for {mRNAs} differentially expressed within an experimental condition compared to those that are not. We found that differentially expressed {mRNAs} correlate significantly better with their protein product than non-differentially expressed {mRNAs}. This result increases confidence for the use of differential {mRNA} expression for biological discovery in this system, as well as providing optimism for the usefulness of inferences from {mRNA} expression in general.}

abstract = {{BACKGROUND} \& {AIMS}: Recently, spatial-temporal/metabolic mathematical models have been established that allow the simulation of metabolic processes in tissues. We applied these models to decipher ammonia detoxification mechanisms in the liver. {METHODS}: An integrated metabolic-spatial-temporal model was used to generate hypotheses of ammonia metabolism. Predicted mechanisms were validated using time-resolved analyses of nitrogen metabolism, activity analyses, immunostaining and gene expression after induction of liver damage in mice. Moreover, blood from the portal vein, liver vein and mixed venous blood was analyzed in a time dependent manner. {RESULTS}: Modeling revealed an underestimation of ammonia consumption after liver damage when only the currently established mechanisms of ammonia detoxification were simulated. By iterative cycles of modeling and experiments, the reductive amidation of alpha-ketoglutarate (\alpha-{KG}) via glutamate dehydrogenase ({GDH}) was identified as the lacking component. {GDH} is released from damaged hepatocytes into the blood where it consumes ammonia to generate glutamate, thereby providing systemic protection against hyperammonemia. This mechanism was exploited therapeutically in a mouse model of hyperammonemia by injecting {GDH} together with optimized doses of cofactors. Intravenous injection of {GDH} (720 U/kg), \alpha-{KG} (280 mg/kg) and {NADPH} (180 mg/kg) reduced the elevated blood ammonia concentrations (\textgreater200 μM) to levels close to normal within only 15 min. {CONCLUSION}: If successfully translated to patients the {GDH}-based therapy might provide a less aggressive therapeutic alternative for patients with severe hyperammonemia.

Although current epigenomic approaches can infer function for chromatin marks through correlation, it remains challenging to establish which marks actually have causative roles in gene regulation and other processes. After revisiting how classical approaches have addressed this question in the past, we discuss the current state of epigenomic profiling and how functional information can be indirectly inferred. We also present new approaches that promise definitive functional answers, which are collectively referred to as 'epigenome editing'. In particular, we explore {CRISPR}-based technologies for single-locus and multi-locus manipulation. Finally, we discuss which level of function can be achieved with each approach and introduce emerging strategies for high-throughput progression from profiles to function.}

We demonstrate Perturb-seq by analyzing 200,000 cells in immune cells and cell lines, focusing on transcription factors regulating the response of dendritic cells to lipopolysaccharide ({LPS}). Perturb-seq accurately identifies individual gene targets, gene signatures, and cell states affected by individual perturbations and their genetic interactions. We posit new functions for regulators of differentiation, the anti-viral response, and mitochondrial function during immune activation. By decomposing many high content measurements into the effects of perturbations, their interactions, and diverse cell metadata, Perturb-seq dramatically increases the scope of pooled genomic assays.

abstract = {Motivation: Phosphoproteomic experiments are increasingly used to study the changes in signaling occurring across different conditions. It has been proposed that changes in phosphorylation of kinase target sites can be used to infer when a kinase activity is under regulation. However, these approaches have not yet been benchmarked due to a lack of appropriate benchmarking strategies. Results: We used curated phosphoproteomic experiments and a gold standard dataset containing a total of 184 kinase-condition pairs where regulation is expected to occur to benchmark and compare different kinase activity inference strategies: Z-test, Kolmogorov Smirnov test, Wilcoxon rank sum test, gene set enrichment analysis ({GSEA}), and a multiple linear regression model. We also tested weighted variants of the Z-test and {GSEA} that include information on kinase sequence specificity as proxy for affinity. Finally, we tested how the number of known substrates and the type of evidence ( in vivo , in vitro or in silico ) supporting these influence the predictions. Conclusions: Most models performed well with the Z-test and the {GSEA} performing best as determined by the area under the {ROC} curve (Mean {AUC} = 0.722). Weighting kinase targets by the kinase target sequence preference improves the results marginally. However, the number of known substrates and the evidence supporting the interactions has a strong effect on the predictions.

abstract = {One of the most common analysis tasks in genomic research is to identify genes that are differentially expressed ({DE}) between experimental conditions. Empirical Bayes ({EB}) statistical tests using moderated genewise variances have been very effective for this purpose, especially when the number of biological replicate samples is small. The {EB} procedures can however be heavily influenced by a small number of genes with very large or very small variances. This article improves the differential expression tests by robustifying the hyperparameter estimation procedure. The robust procedure has the effect of decreasing the informativeness of the prior distribution for outlier genes while increasing its informativeness for other genes. This effect has the double benefit of reducing the chance that hypervariable genes will be spuriously identified as {DE} while increasing statistical power for the main body of genes. The robust {EB} algorithm is fast and numerically stable. The procedure allows exact small-sample null distributions for the test statistics and reduces exactly to the original {EB} procedure when no outlier genes are present. Simulations show that the robustified tests have similar performance to the original tests in the absence of outlier genes but have greater power and robustness when outliers are present. The article includes case studies for which the robust method correctly identifies and downweights genes associated with hidden covariates and detects more genes likely to be scientifically relevant to the experimental conditions. The new procedure is implemented in the limma software package freely available from the Bioconductor repository.}

For example, most classification and regression methods for microarray data are based on the whole set of genes and have not made use of pathway information. Pathway-based analysis in microarray studies may lead to more informative and relevant knowledge for biological researchers. {RESULTS}: In this paper, we describe a pathway-based classification and regression method using Random Forests to analyze gene expression data. The proposed methods allow researchers to rank important pathways from externally available databases, discover important genes, find pathway-based outlying cases and make full use of a continuous outcome variable in the regression setting. We also compared Random Forests with other machine learning methods using several datasets and found that Random Forests classification error rates were either the lowest or the second-lowest. By combining pathway information and novel statistical methods, this procedure represents a promising computational strategy in dissecting pathways and can provide biological insight into the study of microarray data. {AVAILABILITY}: Source code written in R is available from http://bioinformatics.med.yale.edu/pathway-analysis/rf.htm.}

abstract = {Gene set enrichment analysis is a widely used tool for analyzing gene expression data. However, current implementations are slow due to a large number of required samples for the analysis to have a good statistical power. In this paper we present a novel algorithm, that efficiently reuses one sample multiple times and thus speeds up the analysis. We show that it is possible to make hundreds of thousands permutations in a few minutes, which leads to very accurate p-values. This, in turn, allows applying standard {FDR} correction procedures, which are more accurate than the ones currently used. The method is implemented in a form of an R package and is freely available at \textbackslashurl\{https://github.com/ctlab/fgsea\}.}

We applied sci-{RNA}-seq to profile nearly 50,000 cells from the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans at the L2 larval stage, which provided \textgreater50-fold "shotgun" cellular coverage of its somatic cell composition. From these data, we defined consensus expression profiles for 27 cell types and recovered rare neuronal cell types corresponding to as few as one or two cells in the L2 worm. We integrated these profiles with whole-animal chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing data to deconvolve the cell type-specific effects of transcription factors. The data generated by sci-{RNA}-seq constitute a powerful resource for nematode biology and foreshadow similar atlases for other organisms.

We previously published a reference {TF}-target interaction database for humans-{TRRUST} (Transcriptional Regulatory Relationships Unraveled by Sentence-based Text mining)-which was constructed using sentence-based text mining, followed by manual curation. Here, we present {TRRUST} v2 (www.grnpedia.org/trrust) with a significant improvement from the previous version, including a significantly increased size of the database consisting of 8444 regulatory interactions for 800 {TFs} in humans. More importantly, {TRRUST} v2 also contains a database for {TF}-target interactions in mice, including 6552 {TF}-target interactions for 828 mouse {TFs}. {TRRUST} v2 is also substantially more comprehensive and less biased than other {TF}-target interaction databases. We also improved the web interface, which now enables prioritization of key {TFs} for a physiological condition depicted by a set of user-input transcriptional responsive genes. With the significant expansion in the database size and inclusion of the new web tool for {TF} prioritization, we believe that {TRRUST} v2 will be a versatile database for the study of the transcriptional regulation involved in human diseases. \copyright The Author(s) 2017.

abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: A promising direction in the analysis of gene expression focuses on the changes in expression of specific predefined sets of genes that are known in advance to be related (e.g., genes coding for proteins involved in cellular pathways or complexes). Such an analysis can reveal features that are not easily visible from the variations in the individual genes and can lead to a picture of expression that is more biologically transparent and accessible to interpretation. In this article, we present a new method of this kind that operates by quantifying the level of 'activity' of each pathway in different samples. The activity levels, which are derived from singular value decompositions, form the basis for statistical comparisons and other applications. {RESULTS}: We demonstrate our approach using expression data from a study of type 2 diabetes and another of the influence of cigarette smoke on gene expression in airway epithelia. A number of interesting pathways are identified in comparisons between smokers and non-smokers including ones related to nicotine metabolism, mucus production, and glutathione metabolism. A comparison with results from the related approach, 'gene-set enrichment analysis', is also provided. {CONCLUSION}: Our method offers a flexible basis for identifying differentially expressed pathways from gene expression data. The results of a pathway-based analysis can be complementary to those obtained from one more focused on individual genes. A web program {PLAGE} (Pathway Level Analysis of Gene Expression) for performing the kinds of analyses described here is accessible at http://dulci.biostat.edu/pathways.}

abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Gene regulation is one of the most important cellular processes, indispensable for the adaptability of organisms and closely interlinked with several classes of pathogenesis and their progression. Elucidation of regulatory mechanisms can be approached by a multitude of experimental methods, yet integration of the resulting heterogeneous, large, and noisy data sets into comprehensive and tissue or disease-specific cellular models requires rigorous computational methods. Recently, several algorithms have been proposed which model genome-wide gene regulation as sets of (linear) equations over the activity and relationships of transcription factors, genes and other factors. Subsequent optimization finds those parameters that minimize the divergence of predicted and measured expression intensities. In various settings, these methods produced promising results in terms of estimating transcription factor activity and identifying key biomarkers for specific phenotypes. However, despite their common root in mathematical optimization, they vastly differ in the types of experimental data being integrated, the background knowledge necessary for their application, the granularity of their regulatory model, the concrete paradigm used for solving the optimization problem and the data sets used for evaluation. {RESULTS}: Here, we review five recent methods of this class in detail and compare them with respect to several key properties. Furthermore, we quantitatively compare the results of four of the presented methods based on publicly available data sets. {CONCLUSIONS}: The results show that all methods seem to find biologically relevant information. However, we also observe that the mutual result overlaps are very low, which contradicts biological intuition. Our aim is to raise further awareness of the power of these methods, yet also to identify common shortcomings and necessary extensions enabling focused research on the critical points.}

In total 187,946 samples are accessible through {ARCHS4} with 103,083 mouse and 84,863 human. Additionally, the {ARCHS4} web interface provides intuitive exploration of the processed data through querying tools, interactive visualization, and gene pages that provide average expression across cell lines and tissues, top co-expressed genes for each gene, and predicted biological functions and protein-protein interactions for each gene based on prior knowledge combined with co-expression.}

abstract = {In this review we develop the argument that cholestatic liver diseases, particularly primary biliary cholangitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis ({PSC}), evolve over time with anatomically an ascending course of the disease process. The first and early lesions are in "downstream" bile ducts. This eventually leads to cholestasis, and this causes bile salt ({BS})-mediated toxic injury of the "upstream" liver parenchyma. {BS} are toxic in high concentration. These concentrations are present in the canalicular network, bile ducts, and gallbladder. Leakage of bile from this network and ducts could be an important driver of toxicity. The liver has a great capacity to adapt to cholestasis, and this may contribute to a variable symptom-poor interval that is often observed. Current trials with drugs that target {BS} toxicity are effective in only about 50\%-60\% of primary biliary cholangitis patients, with no effective therapy in {PSC}. This motivated us to develop and propose a new view on the pathophysiology of primary biliary cholangitis and {PSC} in the hope that these new drugs can be used more effectively. These views may lead to better stratification of these diseases and to recommendations on a more "tailored" use of the new therapeutic agents that are currently tested in clinical trials. Apical sodium-dependent {BS} transporter inhibitors that reduce intestinal {BS} absorption lower the {BS} load and are best used in cholestatic patients. The effectiveness of {BS} synthesis-suppressing drugs, such as farnesoid X receptor agonists, is greatest when optimal adaptation is not yet established. By the time cytochrome P450 {7A1} expression is reduced these drugs may be less effective. Anti-inflammatory agents are probably most effective in early disease, while drugs that antagonize {BS} toxicity, such as ursodeoxycholic acid and nor-ursodeoxycholic acid, may be effective at all disease stages. Endoscopic stenting in {PSC} should be reserved for situations of intercurrent cholestasis and cholangitis, not for cholestasis in end-stage disease. These are arguments to consider a step-wise pathophysiology for these diseases, with therapy adjusted to disease stage. An obstacle in such an approach is that disease stage-defining biomarkers are still lacking. This review is meant to serve as a call to prioritize the development of biomarkers that help to obtain a better stratification of these diseases.

Here we present {PROGENy}, a method that overcomes both limitations by leveraging a large compendium of publicly available perturbation experiments to yield a common core of Pathway {RespOnsive} {GENes}. Unlike pathway mapping methods, {PROGENy} can (i) recover the effect of known driver mutations, (ii) provide or improve strong markers for drug indications, and (iii) distinguish between oncogenic and tumor suppressor pathways for patient survival.

Yet, some tissues may lack molecular profiles necessary for interactome inference (orphan tissues), or, as for single cells isolated from heterogeneous samples, their tissue context may be undetermined. To address this problem, we introduce {metaVIPER}, an algorithm designed to assess protein activity in tissue-independent fashion by integrative analysis of multiple, non-tissue-matched interactomes. This assumes that transcriptional targets of each protein will be recapitulated by one or more available interactomes. We confirm the algorithm's value in assessing protein dysregulation induced by somatic mutations, as well as in assessing protein activity in orphan tissues and, most critically, in single cells, thus allowing transformation of noisy and potentially biased {RNA}-Seq signatures into reproducible protein-activity signatures.}

Conventional approaches for identifying transcription factors, such as {DNA} sequence motif analysis, are unable to predict functional binding of specific factors and not sensitive enough to detect factors binding at distal enhancers. Here, we present binding analysis for regulation of transcription ({BART}), a novel computational method and software package for predicting functional transcription factors that regulate a query gene set or associate with a query genomic profile, based on more than 6000 existing {ChIP}-seq datasets for over 400 factors in human or mouse. This method demonstrates the advantage of utilizing publicly available data for functional genomics research.

The analysis identified several master regulator proteins, including key regulators of neuroendocrine lineage progenitor state and immunoevasion, whose role as critical tumor dependencies was experimentally confirmed. Transcriptome analysis of {GEP}-{NET}-derived cells, perturbed with a library of 107 compounds, identified the {HDAC} class I inhibitor entinostat as a potent inhibitor of master regulator activity for 42\% of metastatic {GEP}-{NET} patients, abrogating tumor growth in vivo.

abstract = {Bile duct ligation ({BDL}) is an experimental procedure that mimics obstructive cholestatic disease. One of the early consequences of {BDL} in rodents is the appearance of so-called bile infarcts that correspond to Charcot-Gombault necrosis in human cholestasis. The mechanisms causing bile infarcts and their pathophysiological relevance are unclear. Therefore, intravital two photon-based imaging of {BDL} mice was performed with fluorescent bile salts ({BS}) and non-{BS} organic anion analogues. Key findings were followed up by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization imaging, clinical chemistry, immunostaining, and gene expression analyses. In the acute phase, 1-3 days after {BDL}, {BS} concentrations in bile increased and single-cell bile microinfarcts occurred in dispersed hepatocytes throughout the liver caused by the rupture of the apical hepatocyte membrane. This rupture occurred after loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, followed by entry of bile, cell death, and a "domino effect" of further death events of neighboring hepatocytes. Bile infarcts provided a trans-epithelial shunt between bile canaliculi and sinusoids by which bile constituents leaked into blood. In the chronic phase, ≥21 days after {BDL}, uptake of {BS} tracers at the sinusoidal hepatocyte membrane was reduced. This contributes to elevated concentrations of {BS} in blood and decreased concentrations in the biliary tract. Conclusion: Bile microinfarcts occur in the acute phase after {BDL} in a limited number of dispersed hepatocytes followed by larger infarcts involving neighboring hepatocytes, and they allow leakage of bile from the {BS}-overloaded biliary tract into blood, thereby protecting the liver from {BS} toxicity; in the chronic phase after {BDL}, reduced sinusoidal {BS} uptake is a dominant protective factor, and the kidney contributes to the elimination of {BS} until cholemic nephropathy sets in. \copyright 2018 The Authors.

abstract = {{BACKGROUND} \& {AIMS}: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease ({NAFLD}) is the most common chronic liver disorder in industrialized countries. Mouse models of {NAFLD} have been used in studies of pathogenesis and treatment, and have certain features of the human disease. We performed a systematic transcriptome-wide analysis of liver tissues from patients at different stages of {NAFLD} progression (ranging from healthy obese individuals to those with steatosis), as well as rodent models of {NAFLD}, to identify those that most closely resemble human disease progression in terms of gene expression patterns. {METHODS}: We performed a systematic evaluation of genome-wide messenger {RNA} expression using liver tissues collected from mice fed a standard chow diet (controls) and 9 mouse models of {NAFLD}: mice on a high-fat diet (with or without fructose), mice on a Western-type diet, mice on a methionine- and choline-deficient diet, mice on a high-fat diet given streptozotocin, and mice with disruption of Pten in hepatocytes. We compared gene expression patterns with those of liver tissues from 25 patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis ({NASH}), 27 patients with {NAFLD}, 15 healthy obese individuals, and 39 healthy nonobese individuals (controls). Liver samples were obtained from patients undergoing liver biopsy for suspected {NAFLD} or {NASH}, or during liver or bariatric surgeries. Data sets were analyzed using the limma R-package. Overlap of functional profiles was analyzed by gene set enrichment analysis profiles. {RESULTS}: We found differences between human and mouse transcriptomes to be significantly larger than differences between disease stages or models. Of the 65 genes with significantly altered expression in patients with {NASH} and 177 genes with significantly altered expression in patients with {NAFLD}, compared with controls, only 1-18 of these genes also differed significantly in expression between mouse models of {NAFLD} and control mice. However, expression of genes that regulate pathways associated with the development of {NAFLD} were altered in some mouse models (such as pathways associated with lipid metabolism). On a pathway level, gene expression patterns in livers of mice on the high-fat diet were associated more closely with human fatty liver disease than other models. {CONCLUSIONS}: In comparing gene expression profiles between liver tissues from different mouse models of {NAFLD} and patients with different stages of {NAFLD}, we found very little overlap. Our data set is available for studies of pathways that contribute to the development of {NASH} and {NAFLD} and selection of the most applicable mouse models (http://www.nash-profiler.com).

abstract = {{UNLABELLED}: Clinicians rely upon the severity of liver fibrosis to segregate patients with well-compensated nonalcoholic fatty liver disease ({NAFLD}) into subpopulations at high- versus low-risk for eventual liver-related morbidity and mortality. We compared hepatic gene expression profiles in high- and low-risk {NAFLD} patients to identify processes that distinguish the two groups and hence might be novel biomarkers or treatment targets. Microarray analysis was used to characterize gene expression in percutaneous liver biopsies from low-risk, "mild" {NAFLD} patients (fibrosis stage 0-1; n = 40) and high-risk, "severe" {NAFLD} patients (fibrosis stage 3-4; n = 32). Findings were validated in a second, independent cohort and confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry ({IHC}). As a group, patients at risk for bad {NAFLD} outcomes had significantly worse liver injury and more advanced fibrosis (severe {NAFLD}) than clinically indistinguishable {NAFLD} patients with a good prognosis (mild {NAFLD}). A 64-gene profile reproducibly differentiated severe {NAFLD} from mild {NAFLD}, and a 20-gene subset within this profile correlated with {NAFLD} severity, independent of other factors known to influence {NAFLD} progression. Multiple genes involved with tissue repair/regeneration and certain metabolism-related genes were induced in severe {NAFLD}. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis and {IHC} confirmed deregulation of metabolic and regenerative pathways in severe {NAFLD} and revealed overlap among the gene expression patterns of severe {NAFLD}, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. {CONCLUSION}: By demonstrating specific metabolic and repair pathways that are differentially activated in livers with severe {NAFLD}, gene profiling identified novel targets that can be exploited to improve diagnosis and treatment of patients who are at greatest risk for {NAFLD}-related morbidity and mortality. \copyright 2013 by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.}

abstract = {The availability of multiple datasets comprising genome-scale {RNAi} viability screens in hundreds of diverse cancer cell lines presents new opportunities for understanding cancer vulnerabilities. Integrated analyses of these data to assess differential dependency across genes and cell lines are challenging due to confounding factors such as batch effects and variable screen quality, as well as difficulty assessing gene dependency on an absolute scale. To address these issues, we incorporated cell line screen-quality parameters and hierarchical Bayesian inference into {DEMETER2}, an analytical framework for analyzing {RNAi} screens ( https://depmap.org/R2-D2 ). This model substantially improves estimates of gene dependency across a range of performance measures, including identification of gold-standard essential genes and agreement with {CRISPR}/Cas9-based viability screens. It also allows us to integrate information across three large {RNAi} screening datasets, providing a unified resource representing the most extensive compilation of cancer cell line genetic dependencies to date.}

abstract = {The high failure rate of therapeutics showing promise in mouse models to translate to patients is a pressing challenge in biomedical science. Though retrospective studies have examined the fidelity of mouse models to their respective human conditions, approaches for prospective translation of insights from mouse models to patients remain relatively unexplored. Here, we develop a semi-supervised learning approach for inference of disease-associated human differentially expressed genes and pathways from mouse model experiments. We examined 36 transcriptomic case studies where comparable phenotypes were available for mouse and human inflammatory diseases and assessed multiple computational approaches for inferring human biology from mouse datasets. We found that semi-supervised training of a neural network identified significantly more true human biological associations than interpreting mouse experiments directly. Evaluating the experimental design of mouse experiments where our model was most successful revealed principles of experimental design that may improve translational performance. Our study shows that when prospectively evaluating biological associations in mouse studies, semi-supervised learning approaches, combining mouse and human data for biological inference, provide the most accurate assessment of human in vivo disease processes. Finally, we proffer a delineation of four categories of model system-to-human "Translation Problems" defined by the resolution and coverage of the datasets available for molecular insight translation and suggest that the task of translating insights from model systems to human disease contexts may be better accomplished by a combination of translation-minded experimental design and computational approaches.}

Most current meta-analyses of these gene lists include searching for significant membership of the translated proteins in various signaling pathways. However, such membership enrichment algorithms do not provide insight into which pathways caused the genes to be differentially expressed in the first place. Here, we present an intuitive approach for discovering upstream signaling pathways responsible for regulating these differentially expressed genes. We identify consistently regulated signature genes specific for signal transduction pathways from a panel of single-pathway perturbation experiments. An algorithm that detects overrepresentation of these signature genes in a gene group of interest is used to infer the signaling pathway responsible for regulation. We expose our novel resource and algorithm through a web server called {SPEED}: Signaling Pathway Enrichment using Experimental Data sets. {SPEED} can be freely accessed at http://speed.sys-bio.net/.}

Differentiation of human embryonic stem cells ({ESCs}) to {END} offers a tractable system to study the molecular basis of normal and defective human-specific {END} development. Here, we interrogated dynamics in chromatin accessibility during differentiation of {ESCs} to {END}, predicting {DNA}-binding proteins that may drive this cell fate transition. We then combined single-cell {RNA}-seq with parallel {CRISPR} perturbations to comprehensively define the loss-of-function phenotype of those factors in {END} development. Following a few candidates, we revealed distinct impairments in the differentiation trajectories for mediators of {TGF\beta} signaling and expose a role for the {FOXA2} transcription factor in priming human {END} competence for human foregut and hepatic {END} specification.

We detail that {PCR} amplification is another major source of uncoupling, and becomes more pronounced with increased amounts of {DNA} template molecules and {PCR} cycles. To lessen uncoupling in systems that use paired elements for detection, we recommend minimizing the distance between elements, using low and equal template {DNA} inputs for plasmid and genomic {DNA} during {PCR}, and minimizing the number of {PCR} cycles.

We herein aimed to characterize the heterogeneity of these liver mesenchymal cells by single cell {RNA} sequencing. In vivo resting {HSCs} or activated {MFB} were isolated from {C57BL6}/J mice challenged by carbon tetrachloride ({CCl4}) intraperitoneally for 3 weeks to induce liver fibrosis and compared to in vitro cultivated {MFB}. While resting {HSCs} formed a homogenous population characterized by high platelet derived growth factor receptor \beta ({PDGFR\beta}) expression, in vivo and in vitro activated {MFB} split into heterogeneous populations, characterized by \alpha-smooth muscle actin (\alpha-{SMA}), collagens, or immunological markers. S100 calcium binding protein A6 ({S100A6}) was a universal marker of activated {MFB} on both the gene and protein expression level. Compared to the heterogeneity of in vivo {MFB}, {MFB} in vitro sequentially and only transiently expressed marker genes, such as chemokines, during culture activation. Taken together, our data demonstrate the heterogeneity of {HSCs} and {MFB}, indicating the existence of functionally relevant subsets in hepatic fibrosis.}

Here we report the existence of a hepatobiliary hybrid progenitor ({HHyP}) population in human foetal liver using single-cell {RNA} sequencing. {HHyPs} are anatomically restricted to the ductal plate of foetal liver and maintain a transcriptional profile distinct from foetal hepatocytes, mature hepatocytes and mature {BECs}. In addition, molecular heterogeneity within the {EpCAM}+ population of freshly isolated foetal and adult human liver identifies diverse gene expression signatures of hepatic and biliary lineage potential. Finally, we {FACS} isolate foetal {HHyPs} and confirm their hybrid progenitor phenotype in vivo. Our study suggests that hepatobiliary progenitor cells previously identified in mice also exist in humans, and can be distinguished from other parenchymal populations, including mature {BECs}, by distinct gene expression profiles.}

abstract = {The prediction of transcription factor ({TF}) activities from the gene expression of their targets (i.e., {TF} regulon) is becoming a widely used approach to characterize the functional status of transcriptional regulatory circuits. Several strategies and data sets have been proposed to link the target genes likely regulated by a {TF}, each one providing a different level of evidence. The most established ones are (1) manually curated repositories, (2) interactions derived from {ChIP}-seq binding data, (3) in silico prediction of {TF} binding on gene promoters, and (4) reverse-engineered regulons from large gene expression data sets. However, it is not known how these different sources of regulons affect the {TF} activity estimations and, thereby, downstream analysis and interpretation. Here we compared the accuracy and biases of these strategies to define human {TF} regulons by means of their ability to predict changes in {TF} activities in three reference benchmark data sets. We assembled a collection of {TF}-target interactions for 1541 human {TFs} and evaluated how different molecular and regulatory properties of the {TFs}, such as the {DNA}-binding domain, specificities, or mode of interaction with the chromatin, affect the predictions of {TF} activity. We assessed their coverage and found little overlap on the regulons derived from each strategy and better performance by literature-curated information followed by {ChIP}-seq data. We provide an integrated resource of all {TF}-target interactions derived through these strategies, with confidence scores, as a resource for enhanced prediction of {TF} activities. \copyright 2019 Garcia-Alonso et al.; Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.}

abstract = {Liver cirrhosis is a major cause of death worldwide and is characterized by extensive fibrosis. There are currently no effective antifibrotic therapies available. To obtain a better understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in disease pathogenesis and enable the discovery of therapeutic targets, here we profile the transcriptomes of more than 100,000 single human cells, yielding molecular definitions for non-parenchymal cell types that are found in healthy and cirrhotic human liver. We identify a scar-associated {TREM2}+{CD9}+ subpopulation of macrophages, which expands in liver fibrosis, differentiates from circulating monocytes and is pro-fibrogenic. We also define {ACKR1}+ and {PLVAP}+ endothelial cells that expand in cirrhosis, are topographically restricted to the fibrotic niche and enhance the transmigration of leucocytes. Multi-lineage modelling of ligand and receptor interactions between the scar-associated macrophages, endothelial cells and {PDGFR\alpha}+ collagen-producing mesenchymal cells reveals intra-scar activity of several pro-fibrogenic pathways including {TNFRSF12A}, {PDGFR} and {NOTCH} signalling. Our work dissects unanticipated aspects of the cellular and molecular basis of human organ fibrosis at a single-cell level, and provides a conceptual framework for the discovery of rational therapeutic targets in liver cirrhosis.}

abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Many high-throughput experiments compare two phenotypes such as disease vs. healthy, with the goal of understanding the underlying biological phenomena characterizing the given phenotype. Because of the importance of this type of analysis, more than 70 pathway analysis methods have been proposed so far. These can be categorized into two main categories: non-topology-based (non-{TB}) and topology-based ({TB}). Although some review papers discuss this topic from different aspects, there is no systematic, large-scale assessment of such methods. Furthermore, the majority of the pathway analysis approaches rely on the assumption of uniformity of p values under the null hypothesis, which is often not true. {RESULTS}: This article presents the most comprehensive comparative study on pathway analysis methods available to date. We compare the actual performance of 13 widely used pathway analysis methods in over 1085 analyses. These comparisons were performed using 2601 samples from 75 human disease data sets and 121 samples from 11 knockout mouse data sets. In addition, we investigate the extent to which each method is biased under the null hypothesis. Together, these data and results constitute a reliable benchmark against which future pathway analysis methods could and should be tested. {CONCLUSION}: Overall, the result shows that no method is perfect. In general, {TB} methods appear to perform better than non-{TB} methods. This is somewhat expected since the {TB} methods take into consideration the structure of the pathway which is meant to describe the underlying phenomena. We also discover that most, if not all, listed approaches are biased and can produce skewed results under the null.}

However, accomplishing these goals is not easy, requiring careful attention to organization, workflow, and familiarity with tools that are not a regular part of every scientist's toolbox. We have developed an R package, workflowr, to help all scientists, regardless of background, overcome these challenges. Workflowr aims to instill a particular "workflow" - a sequence of steps to be repeated and integrated into research practice - that helps make projects more reproducible and accessible.This workflow integrates four key elements: (1) version control (via Git); (2) literate programming (via R Markdown); (3) automatic checks and safeguards that improve code reproducibility; and (4) sharing code and results via a browsable website. These features exploit powerful existing tools, whose mastery would take considerable study. However, the workflowr interface is simple enough that novice users can quickly enjoy its many benefits. By simply following the workflowr "workflow", R users can create projects whose results, figures, and development history are easily accessible on a static website - thereby conveniently shareable with collaborators by sending them a {URL} - and accompanied by source code and reproducibility safeguards. The workflowr R package is open source and available on {CRAN}, with full documentation and source code available at https://github.com/jdblischak/workflowr.

Linking perturbation signatures to screenings opens the possibility to model cellular phenotypes from expression data and to identify efficacious drugs. We linked perturbation transcriptomics data from the {LINCS}-L1000 project with cell viability information upon genetic (Achilles project) and chemical ({CTRP} screen) perturbations yielding more than 90 000 signature-viability pairs. An integrated analysis showed that the cell viability signature is a major factor underlying perturbation signatures. The signature is linked to transcription factors regulating cell death, proliferation and division time. We used the cell viability-signature relationship to predict viability from transcriptomics signatures, and identified and validated compounds that induce cell death in tumor cell lines. We showed that cellular toxicity can lead to unexpected similarity of signatures, confounding mechanism of action discovery. Consensus compound signatures predicted cell-specific drug sensitivity, even if the signature is not measured in the same cell line, and outperformed conventional drug-specific features. Our results can help in understanding mechanisms behind cell death and removing confounding factors of transcriptomic perturbation screens.

Here we devised an experimental strategy combining {RNA} sequencing and triple-stage mass spectrometry to characterize 193 genetically verified deletions targeting 136 distinct genes generated by {CRISPR}-induced frameshifts in {HAP1} cells. We observed residual protein expression for about one third of the quantified targets, at variable levels from low to original, and identified two causal mechanisms, translation reinitiation leading to N-terminally truncated target proteins or skipping of the edited exon leading to protein isoforms with internal sequence deletions. Detailed analysis of three truncated targets, {BRD4}, {DNMT1} and {NGLY1}, revealed partial preservation of protein function.

Hepatic stellate cells ({HSCs}) are a major source of pathological matrix during fibrosis and are thought to be a functionally homogeneous population. Here, we use single-cell {RNA} sequencing to deconvolve the hepatic mesenchyme in healthy and fibrotic mouse liver, revealing spatial zonation of {HSCs} across the hepatic lobule. Furthermore, we show that {HSCs} partition into topographically diametric lobule regions, designated portal vein-associated {HSCs} ({PaHSCs}) and central vein-associated {HSCs} ({CaHSCs}). Importantly we uncover functional zonation, identifying {CaHSCs} as the dominant pathogenic collagen-producing cells in a mouse model of centrilobular fibrosis. Finally, we identify {LPAR1} as a therapeutic target on collagen-producing {CaHSCs}, demonstrating that blockade of {LPAR1} inhibits liver fibrosis in a rodent {NASH} model.

The use of prior knowledge in {CARNIVAL} enables capturing a broad set of upstream cellular processes and regulators, leading to a higher accuracy when benchmarked against related tools. Implementation as an integer linear programming ({ILP}) problem guarantees efficient computation. As a case study, we applied {CARNIVAL} to contextualize signaling networks from gene expression data in {IgA} nephropathy ({IgAN}), a condition that can lead to chronic kidney disease. {CARNIVAL} identified specific signaling pathways and associated mediators dysregulated in {IgAN} including Wnt and {TGF}-\beta, which we subsequently validated experimentally.

abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Gene set scoring provides a useful approach for quantifying concordance between sample transcriptomes and selected molecular signatures. Most methods use information from all samples to score an individual sample, leading to unstable scores in small data sets and introducing biases from sample composition (e.g. varying numbers of samples for different cancer subtypes). To address these issues, we have developed a truly single sample scoring method, and associated R/Bioconductor package singscore ( https://bioconductor.org/packages/singscore ). {RESULTS}: We use multiple cancer data sets to compare singscore against widely-used methods, including {GSVA}, z-score, {PLAGE}, and {ssGSEA}. Our approach does not depend upon background samples and scores are thus stable regardless of the composition and number of samples being scored. In contrast, scores obtained by {GSVA}, z-score, {PLAGE} and {ssGSEA} can be unstable when less data are available ({NS} \textless  25). The singscore method performs as well as the best performing methods in terms of power, recall, false positive rate and computational time, and provides consistently high and balanced performance across all these criteria. To enhance the impact and utility of our method, we have also included a set of functions implementing visual analysis and diagnostics to support the exploration of molecular phenotypes in single samples and across populations of data. {CONCLUSIONS}: The singscore method described here functions independent of sample composition in gene expression data and thus it provides stable scores, which are particularly useful for small data sets or data integration. Singscore performs well across all performance criteria, and includes a suite of powerful visualization functions to assist in the interpretation of results. This method performs as well as or better than other scoring approaches in terms of its power to distinguish samples with distinct biology and its ability to call true differential gene sets between two conditions. These scores can be used for dimensional reduction of transcriptomic data and the phenotypic landscapes obtained by scoring samples against multiple molecular signatures may provide insights for sample stratification.}

We finally construct {InfoSigMap}, an interactive online map of these signatures and their cross-correlations. This map highlights the structure of compositional and functional redundancies between informative signatures, and it charts the territories of biological functions. {InfoSigMap} can be used to visualize the results of omics data analyses and suggests a rearrangement of existing gene sets.}

abstract = {The study of biological systems at a system level has become a reality due to the increasing powerful computational approaches able to handle increasingly larger datasets. Uncovering the dynamic nature of gene regulatory networks in order to attain a system level understanding and improve the predictive power of biological models is an important research field in systems biology. The task itself presents several challenges, since the problem is of combinatorial nature and highly depends on several biological constraints and also the intended application. Given the intrinsic interdisciplinary nature of gene regulatory network inference, we present a review on the currently available approaches, their challenges and limitations. We propose guidelines to select the most appropriate method considering the underlying assumptions and fundamental biological and data constraints. Copyright \copyright 2018 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Transcriptome profiling followed by differential gene expression analysis often leads to lists of genes that are hard to analyze and interpret. Functional genomics tools are powerful approaches for downstream analysis, as they summarize the large and noisy gene expression space into a smaller number of biological meaningful features. In particular, methods that estimate the activity of processes by mapping transcripts level to process members are popular. However, footprints of either a pathway or transcription factor ({TF}) on gene expression show superior performance over mapping-based gene sets. These footprints are largely developed for humans and their usability in the broadly-used model organism Mus musculus is uncertain. Evolutionary conservation of the gene regulatory system suggests that footprints of human pathways and {TFs} can functionally characterize mice data. In this paper we analyze this hypothesis. We perform a comprehensive benchmark study exploiting two state-of-the-art footprint methods, {DoRothEA} and an extended version of {PROGENy}. These methods infer {TF} and pathway activity, respectively. Our results show that both can recover mouse perturbations, confirming our hypothesis that footprints are conserved between mice and humans. Subsequently, we illustrate the usability of {PROGENy} and {DoRothEA} by recovering pathway/{TF}-disease associations from newly generated disease sets. Additionally, we provide pathway and {TF} activity scores for a large collection of human and mouse perturbation and disease experiments (2374). We believe that this resource, available for interactive exploration and download (https://saezlab.shinyapps.io/footprint\_scores/), can have broad applications including the study of diseases and therapeutics.

Well-defined associations between gene expression profiles and disease progression would benefit efforts to develop novel therapies and to understand disease heterogeneity. We analyzed hepatic gene expression in controls and a cohort with the full histological spectrum of {NAFLD}. Protein-protein interaction and gene set variation analysis revealed distinct sets of coordinately regulated genes and pathways whose expression progressively change over the course of the disease. The progressive nature of these changes enabled us to develop a framework for calculating a disease progression score for individual genes. We show that, in aggregate, these scores correlate strongly with histological measures of disease progression and can thus themselves serve as a proxy for severity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the expression levels of a small number of genes (\~20) can be used to infer disease severity. Finally, we show that patient subgroups can be distinguished by the relative distribution of gene-level scores in specific gene sets. While future work is required to identify the specific disease characteristics that correspond to patient clusters identified on this basis, this work provides a general framework for the use of high-content molecular profiling to identify {NAFLD} patient subgroups.}

abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Many functional analysis tools have been developed to extract functional and mechanistic insight from bulk transcriptome data. With the advent of single-cell {RNA} sequencing ({scRNA}-seq), it is in principle possible to do such an analysis for single cells. However, {scRNA}-seq data has characteristics such as drop-out events and low library sizes. It is thus not clear if functional {TF} and pathway analysis tools established for bulk sequencing can be applied to {scRNA}-seq in a meaningful way. {RESULTS}: To address this question, we perform benchmark studies on simulated and real {scRNA}-seq data. We include the bulk-{RNA} tools {PROGENy}, {GO} enrichment, and {DoRothEA} that estimate pathway and transcription factor ({TF}) activities, respectively, and compare them against the tools {SCENIC}/{AUCell} and {metaVIPER}, designed for {scRNA}-seq. For the in silico study, we simulate single cells from {TF}/pathway perturbation bulk {RNA}-seq experiments. We complement the simulated data with real {scRNA}-seq data upon {CRISPR}-mediated knock-out. Our benchmarks on simulated and real data reveal comparable performance to the original bulk data. Additionally, we show that the {TF} and pathway activities preserve cell type-specific variability by analyzing a mixture sample sequenced with 13 {scRNA}-seq protocols. We also provide the benchmark data for further use by the community. {CONCLUSIONS}: Our analyses suggest that bulk-based functional analysis tools that use manually curated footprint gene sets can be applied to {scRNA}-seq data, partially outperforming dedicated single-cell tools. Furthermore, we find that the performance of functional analysis tools is more sensitive to the gene sets than to the statistic used.}

abstract = {Introduction: To develop effective therapies and identify novel early biomarkers for chronic kidney disease, an understanding of the molecular mechanisms orchestrating it is essential. We here set out to understand how differences in chronic kidney disease ({CKD}) origin are reflected in gene expression. To this end, we integrated publicly available human glomerular microarray gene expression data for 9 kidney disease entities that account for most of {CKD} worldwide. Our primary goal was to demonstrate the possibilities and potential on data analysis and integration to the nephrology community. Methods: We integrated data from 5 publicly available studies and compared glomerular gene expression profiles of disease with that of controls from nontumor parts of kidney cancer nephrectomy tissues. A major challenge was the integration of the data from different sources, platforms, and conditions that we mitigated with a bespoke stringent procedure. Results: We performed a global transcriptome-based delineation of different kidney disease entities, obtaining a transcriptomic diffusion map of their similarities and differences based on the genes that acquire a consistent differential expression between each kidney disease entity and nephrectomy tissue. We derived functional insights by inferring the activity of signaling pathways and transcription factors from the collected gene expression data and identified potential drug candidates based on expression signature matching. We validated representative findings by immunostaining in human kidney biopsies indicating, for example, that the transcription factor {FOXM1} is significantly and specifically expressed in parietal epithelial cells in rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis ({RPGN}) whereas not expressed in control kidney tissue. Furthermore, we found drug candidates by matching the signature on expression of drugs to that of the {CKD} entities, in particular, the Food and Drug Administration-approved drug nilotinib. Conclusion: These results provide a foundation to comprehend the specific molecular mechanisms underlying different kidney disease entities that can pave the way to identify biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets. To facilitate further use, we provide our results as a free interactive Web application: https://saezlab.shinyapps.io/ckd\_landscape/. However, because of the limitations of the data and the difficulties in its integration, any specific result should be considered with caution. Indeed, we consider this study rather an illustration of the value of functional genomics and integration of existing data. \copyright 2019 International Society of Nephrology.

This study presents a simple method to infer the regulation of transcription factors from microarray data based on well-characterized target genes. We generated a catalog containing transcription factors associated with 2720 target genes and 6401 experimentally validated regulations. When it was available, a distinction between transcriptional activation and inhibition was included for each regulation. Next, we built a tool (www.tfacts.org) that compares submitted gene lists with target genes in the catalog to detect regulated transcription factors. {TFactS} was validated with published lists of regulated genes in various models and compared to tools based on in silico promoter analysis. We next analyzed the {NCI60} cancer microarray data set and showed the regulation of {SOX10}, {MITF} and {JUN} in melanomas. We then performed microarray experiments comparing gene expression response of human fibroblasts stimulated by different growth factors. {TFactS} predicted the specific activation of Signal transducer and activator of transcription factors by {PDGF}-{BB}, which was confirmed experimentally. Our results show that the expression levels of transcription factor target genes constitute a robust signature for transcription factor regulation, and can be efficiently used for microarray data mining.}

Considering the ongoing obesity epidemic beginning in childhood, the rise in diabetes, and other factors, the prevalence of {NAFLD} along with the proportion of those with advanced liver disease is projected to continue to increase. This will have an important impact on public health reflected in health care costs, including impact on the need for liver transplantation, for which nonalcoholic steatohepatitis is already close to becoming the most common indication. {NAFLD} patients with evidence of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and advanced fibrosis are at markedly increased risk of adverse outcomes, including overall mortality, and liver-specific morbidity and mortality, respectively.

To address this question, we used three mouse models of liver fibrosis, repeated {CCl4} administration for 2, 6 and 12 months to induce pericentral damage, as well as bile duct ligation (21 days) and mdr2-/- mice to study periportal fibrosis. Analyses were performed by {RNA}-sequencing, immunostaining of zonated proteins and image analysis. {RNA}-sequencing demonstrated a significant enrichment of pericentral genes among genes downregulated by {CCl4}; vice versa, periportal genes were enriched among the upregulated genes. Immunostaining showed an almost complete loss of pericentral proteins, such as cytochrome P450 enzymes and glutamine synthetase, while periportal proteins, such as arginase 1 and {CPS1} became expressed also in pericentral hepatocytes. This pattern of fibrosis-associated 'periportalization' was consistently observed in all three mouse models and led to complete resistance to hepatotoxic doses of acetaminophen (200 mg/kg). Characterization of the expression response identified the inflammatory pathways {TGF\beta}, {NF\kappaB}, {TNF\alpha}, and transcription factors {NFKb1}, Stat1, Hif1a, Trp53, and Atf1 among those activated, while estrogen-associated pathways, Hnf4a and Hnf1a, were decreased. In conclusion, liver fibrosis leads to strong alterations of lobular zonation, where the pericentral region adopts periportal features. Beside adverse consequences, periportalization supports adaptation to repeated doses of hepatotoxic compounds.}

Instead of treating dropouts as a problem to be fixed, we embrace it as a useful signal. We represent the dropout pattern by binarizing single-cell {RNA}-seq count data, and present a co-occurrence clustering algorithm to cluster cells based on the dropout pattern. We demonstrate in multiple published datasets that the binary dropout pattern is as informative as the quantitative expression of highly variable genes for the purpose of identifying cell types.

Many cytokines involved in the pathogenesis of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases use {JAKs} and {STATs} to transduce intracellular signals. Mutations in {JAK} and {STAT} genes cause a number of immunodeficiency syndromes, and polymorphisms in these genes are associated with autoimmune diseases. The success of small-molecule {JAK} inhibitors (Jakinibs) in the treatment of rheumatologic disease demonstrates that intracellular signaling pathways can be targeted therapeutically to treat autoimmunity. Tofacitinib, the first rheumatologic Jakinib, is {US} Food and Drug Administration ({FDA}) approved for rheumatoid arthritis and is currently under investigation for other autoimmune diseases. Many other Jakinibs are in preclinical development or in various phases of clinical trials. This review describes the {JAK}-{STAT} pathway, outlines its role in autoimmunity, and explains the rationale/pre-clinical evidence for targeting {JAK}-{STAT} signaling. The safety and clinical efficacy of the Jakinibs are reviewed, starting with the {FDA}-approved Jakinib tofacitinib, and continuing on to next-generation Jakinibs.

The latest protocols are scalable to thousands of cells and are being used to compile cell atlases of tissues, organs and organisms. However, the protocols differ substantially with respect to their {RNA} capture efficiency, bias, scale and costs, and their relative advantages for different applications are unclear. In the present study, we generated benchmark datasets to systematically evaluate protocols in terms of their power to comprehensively describe cell types and states. We performed a multicenter study comparing 13 commonly used {scRNA}-seq and single-nucleus {RNA}-seq protocols applied to a heterogeneous reference sample resource. Comparative analysis revealed marked differences in protocol performance. The protocols differed in library complexity and their ability to detect cell-type markers, impacting their predictive value and suitability for integration into reference cell atlases. These results provide guidance both for individual researchers and for consortium projects such as the Human Cell Atlas.}

The expression levels of {LTBP2} at messenger {RNA} ({mRNA}) and protein levels in 60 cases of {HCC} and adjacent tissues were detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunohisochemistry. Statistical analysis was used to analyze the relationship between {LTBP2} and clinical characteristics of patients with {HCC}.The {mRNA} and protein levels of {LTBP2} were significantly upregulated in {HCC} tissues compared to adjacent tissues. Additionally, higher serum {LTBP2} level was also observed in {HCC} patients relative to normal controls. Further investigation demonstrated that {LTBP2} expression was associated with malignant degree of tumor, tumor progression, tumor differentiation, tumor size, tumor stage and hepatitis virus infection, and has prognostic implications in {HCC} patients.{LTBP2} might be served as a potential biomarker in diagnosis and treatment of {HCC}.}

However, accurately predicting the transcription factors ({TFs}) and cofactors that drive transcriptomic differences between samples is challenging. A number of algorithms draw on {ChIP}-seq tracks to define {TFs} and cofactors behind gene changes. These approaches assign {TFs} and cofactors to genes via a binary designation of 'target', or 'non-target' followed by Fisher Exact Tests to assess enrichment of {TFs} and cofactors. {ENCODE} archives 2314 {ChIP}-seq tracks of 684 {TFs} and cofactors assayed across a 117 human cell lines under a multitude of growth and maintenance conditions. The algorithm presented herein, Mining Algorithm for {GenetIc} Controllers ({MAGIC}), uses {ENCODE} {ChIP}-seq data to look for statistical enrichment of {TFs} and cofactors in gene bodies and flanking regions in gene lists without an a priori binary classification of genes as targets or non-targets. When compared to other {TF} mining resources, {MAGIC} displayed favourable performance in predicting {TFs} and cofactors that drive gene changes in 4 settings: 1) A cell line expressing or lacking single {TF}, 2) Breast tumors divided along {PAM50} designations 3) Whole brain samples from {WT} mice or mice lacking a single {TF} in a particular neuronal subtype 4) Single cell {RNAseq} analysis of neurons divided by Immediate Early Gene expression levels. In summary, {MAGIC} is a standalone application that produces meaningful predictions of {TFs} and cofactors in transcriptomic experiments.}

The overall correlation between {mRNA} and protein expression was weakly positive with a Spearman rank correlation coefficient of 0.45 for 678 loci. To place the data sets in a proper biological context, a clustering approach based on protein pathways and protein complexes was implemented. Protein expression levels were transcriptionally controlled for not only single loci but for entire protein pathways (e.g., Met, Arg, and Leu biosynthetic pathways). In contrast, the protein expression of loci in several protein complexes (e.g., {SPT}, {COPI}, and ribosome) was posttranscriptionally controlled. The coupling of the methods described provided insight into the biology of S. cerevisiae and a clustering strategy by which future studies should be based.}

A popular method to do so is by enrichment analysis of signature genes in e.g. differentially regulated genes. Previously, we derived signatures for signalling pathways by integrating public perturbation transcriptome data and generated a signature database called {SPEED} (Signalling Pathway Enrichment using Experimental Datasets), for which we here present a substantial upgrade as {SPEED2}. This web server hosts consensus signatures for 16 signalling pathways that are derived from a large number of transcriptomic signalling perturbation experiments. When providing a gene list of e.g. differentially expressed genes, the web server allows to infer signalling pathways that likely caused these genes to be deregulated. In addition to signature lists, we derive 'continuous' gene signatures, in a transparent and automated fashion without any fine-tuning, and describe a new algorithm to score these signatures. \copyright The Author(s) 2020.

Biological pathways in distinct cell types have different activation patterns, which facilitates the understanding of cell functions using single-cell transcriptomics. However, no effective web tool has been implemented for single-cell transcriptome data analysis based on prior biological pathway knowledge. {RESULTS}: Here, we present {scTPA}, a web-based platform for pathway-based analysis of single-cell {RNA}-seq data in human and mouse. {scTPA} incorporates four widely-used gene set enrichment methods to estimate the pathway activation scores of single cells based on a collection of available biological pathways with different functional and taxonomic classifications. The clustering analysis and cell-type-specific activation pathway identification were provided for the functional interpretation of cell types from a pathway-oriented perspective. An intuitive interface allows users to conveniently visualize and download single-cell pathway signatures.

Here we present an improved version of {SCENIC} with several advances. {SCENIC} has been refactored and reimplemented in Python ({pySCENIC}), resulting in a tenfold increase in speed, and has been packaged into containers for ease of use. It is now also possible to use epigenomic track databases, as well as motifs, to refine regulons. In this protocol, we explain the different steps of {SCENIC}: the workflow starts from the count matrix depicting the gene abundances for all cells and consists of three stages. First, coexpression modules are inferred using a regression per-target approach ({GRNBoost2}). Next, the indirect targets are pruned from these modules using cis-regulatory motif discovery ({cisTarget}). Lastly, the activity of these regulons is quantified via an enrichment score for the regulon's target genes ({AUCell}). Nonlinear projection methods can be used to display visual groupings of cells based on the cellular activity patterns of these regulons. The results can be exported as a loom file and visualized in the {SCope} web application. This protocol is illustrated on two use cases: a peripheral blood mononuclear cell data set and a panel of single-cell {RNA}-sequencing cancer experiments. For a data set of 10,000 genes and 50,000 cells, the pipeline runs in \textless 2 h.}

This has clear implications for therapeutic interventions that are designed to capitalize on this inherent plasticity. However, despite substantial progress in our understanding of the pathobiology of fibrosis, a translational gap remains between the identification of putative antifibrotic targets and conversion of this knowledge into effective treatments in humans. Here we discuss the transformative experimental strategies that are being leveraged to dissect the key cellular and molecular mechanisms that regulate fibrosis, and the translational approaches that are enabling the emergence of precision medicine-based therapies for patients with fibrosis.}

abstract = {{BACKGROUND} \& {AIMS}: In chronic liver diseases, inflammation induces oxidative stress and thus may contribute to the progression of liver injury, fibrosis, and carcinogenesis. The {KEAP1}/{NRF2} axis is a major regulator of cellular redox balance. In the present study, we investigated whether the {KEAP1}/{NRF2} system is involved in liver disease progression in humans and mice. {METHODS}: The clinical relevance of oxidative stress was investigated by liver {RNA} sequencing in a well-characterized cohort of patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (n = 63) and correlated with histological and clinical parameters. For functional analysis, hepatocyte-specific Nemo knockout ({NEMO\Deltahepa}) mice were crossed with hepatocyte-specific Keap1 knockout ({KEAP1\Deltahepa}) mice. {RESULTS}: Immunohistochemical analysis of human liver sections showed increased oxidative stress and high {NRF2} expression in patients with chronic liver disease. {RNA} sequencing of liver samples in a human pediatric {NAFLD} cohort revealed a significant increase of {NRF2} activation correlating with the grade of inflammation, but not with the grade of steatosis, which could be confirmed in a second adult {NASH} cohort. In mice, microarray analysis revealed that Keap1 deletion induces {NRF2} target genes involved in glutathione metabolism and xenobiotic stress (e.g., Nqo1). Furthermore, deficiency of one of the most important antioxidants, glutathione ({GSH}), in {NEMO\Deltahepa} livers was rescued after deleting Keap1. As a consequence, {NEMO\Deltahepa}/{KEAP1\Deltahepa} livers showed reduced apoptosis compared to {NEMO\Deltahepa} livers as well as a dramatic downregulation of genes involved in cell cycle regulation and {DNA} replication. Consequently, {NEMO\Deltahepa}/{KEAP1\Deltahepa} compared to {NEMO\Deltahepa} livers displayed decreased fibrogenesis, lower tumor incidence, reduced tumor number, and decreased tumor size. {CONCLUSIONS}: {NRF2} activation in patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis correlates with the grade of inflammation, but not steatosis. Functional analysis in mice demonstrated that {NRF2} activation in chronic liver disease is protective by ameliorating fibrogenesis, initiation and progression of hepatocellular carcinogenesis. {LAY} {SUMMARY}: The {KEAP1} (Kelch-like {ECH}-associated protein-1)/{NRF2} (erythroid 2-related factor 2) axis has a major role in regulating cellular redox balance. Herein, we show that {NRF2} activity correlates with the grade of inflammation in patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. Functional studies in mice actually show that {NRF2} activation, resulting from {KEAP1} deletion, protects against fibrosis and cancer.

Although numerous methods for identifying dysregulated genes have been proposed, few of them aim to distinguish genes that are the real source of perturbation from those that merely respond to the signal dysregulation. Here, we propose a new method, called {SourceSet}, able to distinguish between the primary and the secondary dysregulation within a Gaussian graphical model context. The proposed method compares gene expression profiles in the control and in the perturbed condition and detects the differences in both the mean and the covariance parameters with a series of likelihood ratio tests. The resulting evidence is used to infer the primary and the secondary set, i.e. the genes responsible for the primary dysregulation, and the genes affected by the perturbation through network propagation. The proposed method demonstrates high specificity and sensitivity in different simulated scenarios and on several real biological case studies. In order to fit into the more traditional pathway analysis framework, {SourceSet} R package also extends the analysis from a single to multiple pathways and provides several graphical outputs, including Cytoscape visualization to browse the results.}

abstract = {The {ETS} transcription factors regulate expression of genes involved in normal cell development, proliferation, differentiation, angiogenesis, and apoptosis, consisting of 28 family members in humans. Dysregulation of these transcription factors facilitates cell proliferation in cancers, and several members participate in invasion and metastasis by activating gene transcription. {ETS1} and {ETS2} are the founding members of the {ETS} family and regulate transcription by binding to {ETS} sequences. They are both involved in oncogenesis and tumor suppression depending on the biological situations used. The essential roles of {ETS} proteins in human telomere maintenance have been suggested, which have been linked to creation of new Ets binding sites. Recently, preferential binding of {ETS2} to gain-of-function mutant p53 and {ETS1} to wild type p53 ({WTp53}) has been suggested, raising the tumor promoting role for the former and tumor suppressive role for the latter. The oncogenic and tumor suppressive functions of {ETS1} and 2 proteins have been discussed.}

Vascular endothelial growth factor protein family ({VEGF}) and its receptors are probably the most important tissue factors responsible for angioblast differentiation and tube formation. {VEGF} protein family currently comprises several members: {VEGF} (or {VEGF}-A), {VEGF}-B, {VEGF}-C and {VEGF}-D, {VEGF}-F, placental growth factor ({PlGF}), and their receptors {VEGFR}-1, {VEGFR}-2 and {VEGFR}-3. {VEGF} is a key angiogenic growth factor and its level of expression is a critical marker for detection of the angiogenic diseases. The potent role of {VEGF} in tumor angiogenesis has been widely described in the past decade, being expressed in most types of nondigestive and digestive cancers. {VEGF} family members play an important role in the development of pancreatic cancer (especially {VEGF}-A, {VEGF}-C, {VEGF}-D, {VEGFR}-1 and {VEGFR}-2). {VEGF}-A is the most specific and prominent angiogenic factor among all family members and {VEGFR}-2 is the most important receptor in evaluating the angiogenesis in pancreatic cancer. Thus, {VEGF} overexpression may be considered as a diagnostic marker and as a poor prognostic factor of the disease.}

abstract = {Complex molecular and cellular mechanisms are involved in the pathway of liver fibrosis. Activation and transformation of hepatic stellate cells ({HSCs}) are considered the two main reasons for the cause and development of liver fibrosis. The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors ({PPARs}) belonging to the family of ligand-activated transcription factors play a key role in liver homeostasis, regulating adipogenesis and inhibiting fibrogenesis in {HSCs}. Normal transcriptional function of {PPARs} contributes to maintain {HSCs} in quiescent phase. A reduced expression of {PPARs} in {HSCs} greatly induces a progression of liver fibrosis and an increased production of collagen. Here, we discuss role and function of {PPARs} and we take into consideration molecular factors able to reduce {PPARs} activity in {HSCs}. Finally, although further validations are needed, we illustrate novel strategies available from in vitro and animal studies on how some {PPARs}-agonists have been proved effective as antifibrotic substances in liver disease.}

Here, the {MHC} class-{II}-specific transcription factors and {CREB} were expressed in insect cells with recombinant baculoviruses, isolated, and characterized by biochemical and biophysical methods. Analytical ultracentrifugation ({AUC}) has demonstrated that {RFX} is a heterotrimer. A heterodimer of {RFX5} and {RFX}-{AP} was also observed. A high-affinity interaction (K(d) = 25 {nM}) between {RFX5} and {RFX}-{AP} was measured by isothermal titration calorimetry ({ITC}), while the interaction between {RFX}-{AP} and {RFX}-{ANK} is at least an order of magnitude weaker. The biophysical data show that the interaction between {RFX}-{AP} and {RFX5} is a key event in the assembly of the heterotrimer. Fluorescence anisotropy was used to determine protein-nucleic acid binding affinities for the {RFX} subunits and complexes binding to duplex {DNA}. The {RFX5} subunit was found to drive recognition of the promoter, while the auxiliary {RFX}-{AP} and {RFX}-{ANK} subunits were shown to contribute to the specificity of binding for the overall complex. {AUC} experiments demonstrate that in the absence of additional subunits, monomeric {RFX5} binds to X-box {DNA} with a 1:1 stoichiometry. Interactions between {CREB}, {CIITA}, and {RFX} in the absence of {DNA} were demonstrated using bead-based immunoprecipitation assays, confirming that preassociation with {DNA} is not required for forming the macromolecular assemblies that drive {MHC} class {II} gene expression.}

abstract = {The maintenance of B cell homeostasis requires a tight control of B cell generation, survival, activation, and maturation. In lymphocytes upon activation, increased sensitivity to apoptotic signals helps controlling differentiation and proliferation. The death receptor Fas is important in this context because genetic Fas mutations in humans lead to an autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome that is similar to lymphoproliferation observed in Fas-deficient mice. In contrast, the physiological role of {TNF}-related apoptosis-inducing ligand receptors ({TRAIL}-Rs) in humans has been poorly studied so far. Indeed, most studies have focused on tumor cell lines and on mouse models whose results are difficult to transpose to primary human B cells. In the present work, the expression of apoptosis-inducing {TRAIL}-R1 and {TRAIL}-R2 and of the decoy receptors {TRAIL}-R3 and {TRAIL}-R4 was systematically studied in all developmental stages of peripheral B cells isolated from the blood and secondary lymphoid organs. Expression of {TRAIL}-Rs is modulated along development, with highest levels observed in germinal center B cells. In addition, T-dependent and T-independent signals elicited induction of {TRAIL}-Rs with distinct kinetics, which differed among B cell subpopulations: switched memory cells rapidly upregulated {TRAIL}-R1 and -2 upon activation while naïve B cells only reached similar expression levels at later time points in culture. Increased expression of {TRAIL}-R1 and -2 coincided with a caspase-3-dependent sensitivity to {TRAIL}-induced apoptosis in activated B cells but not in freshly isolated resting B cells. Finally, both {TRAIL}-R1 and {TRAIL}-R2 could signal actively and both contributed to {TRAIL}-induced apoptosis. In conclusion, this study provides a systematic analysis of the expression of {TRAIL}-Rs in human primary B cells and of their capacity to signal and induce apoptosis. This dataset forms a basis to further study and understand the dysregulation of {TRAIL}-Rs and {TRAIL} expression observed in autoimmune diseases. Additionally, it will be important to foresee potential bystander immunomodulation when {TRAIL}-R agonists are used in cancer treatment.}

As a result, proliferation is deregulated, and sensitivity to apoptotic stimuli is increased. In cell culture studies, the transcription factor {E2F1} has been shown to be equally adept at inducing proliferation and apoptosis. Several groups using mouse models have been examining how these {E2F1}-regulated processes impact the development of cancer. The conclusion from these studies is that {E2F1} can function as both oncogene and tumor suppressor gene and that both positive and negative effects on tumorigenesis can be observed whether {E2F1} is absent or overexpressed.

Hepatocellular carcinoma ({HCC}) is the most common form of liver cancer and accounts for \~90\% of cases. Infection by hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus are the main risk factors for {HCC} development, although non-alcoholic steatohepatitis associated with metabolic syndrome or diabetes mellitus is becoming a more frequent risk factor in the West. Moreover, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis-associated {HCC} has a unique molecular pathogenesis. Approximately 25\% of all {HCCs} present with potentially actionable mutations, which are yet to be translated into the clinical practice. Diagnosis based upon non-invasive criteria is currently challenged by the need for molecular information that requires tissue or liquid biopsies. The current major advancements have impacted the management of patients with advanced {HCC}. Six systemic therapies have been approved based on phase {III} trials (atezolizumab plus bevacizumab, sorafenib, lenvatinib, regorafenib, cabozantinib and ramucirumab) and three additional therapies have obtained accelerated {FDA} approval owing to evidence of efficacy. New trials are exploring combination therapies, including checkpoint inhibitors and tyrosine kinase inhibitors or anti-{VEGF} therapies, or even combinations of two immunotherapy regimens. The outcomes of these trials are expected to change the landscape of {HCC} management at all evolutionary stages.}

We calculated proportion trends for common {CLD} etiologies at time of placement on the wait list, including chronic infection with hepatitis B virus, chronic infection with hepatitis C virus ({HCV}), nonalcoholic steatohepatitis ({NASH}, including cryptogenic cirrhosis), alcohol-related liver disease ({ALD}) without or with chronic {HCV} infection, autoimmune hepatitis, primary biliary cholangitis, and primary sclerosing cholangitis, in patients with and without hepatocellular carcinoma ({HCC}). {RESULTS}: From the 168,441 patients with known etiology and non-acute liver failure on the liver transplant waitlist, 27,799 patients (16.5\%) had {HCC}. In 2002, the most common etiologies in patients without {HCC} were chronic {HCV} infection (37\%) and {ALD} (16\%), whereas only 5\% had {NASH}.

Here, we analyzed the sequential processes during onset of liver injury and subsequent regeneration based on time-resolved transcriptional regulatory networks ({TRNs}) to understand the relationship between inflammation, mature organ function, and regeneration. Genome-wide expression and {TRN} analysis were performed time dependently in mouse liver after acute injury by {CCl4} (2 h, 8 h, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 16 days), as well as lipopolysaccharide ({LPS}, 24 h) and compared to publicly available data after tunicamycin exposure (mouse, 6 h), hepatocellular carcinoma ({HCC}, mouse), and human chronic liver disease (non-alcoholic fatty liver, {HBV} infection and {HCC}). Spatiotemporal investigation differentiated lobular zones for signaling and transcription factor expression. Acute {CCl4} intoxication induced expression of gene clusters enriched for inflammation and stress signaling that peaked between 2 and 24 h, accompanied by a decrease of mature liver functions, particularly metabolic genes. Metabolism decreased not only in pericentral hepatocytes that underwent {CCl4}-induced necrosis, but extended to the surviving periportal hepatocytes. Proliferation and tissue restorative {TRNs} occurred only later reaching a maximum at 48 h. The same upstream regulators (e.g. inhibited {RXR} function) were implicated in increased inflammation and suppressed metabolism. The concomitant inflammation/metabolism {TRN} occurred similarly after acute {LPS} and tunicamycin challenges, in chronic mouse models and also in human liver diseases. Downregulation of metabolic genes occurs concomitantly to induce inflammation-associated genes as an early response and appears to be initiated by similar upstream regulators in acute and chronic liver diseases in humans and mice. In the acute setting, proliferation and restorative regeneration associated {TRNs} peak only later when metabolism is already suppressed.}

abstract = {Acetaminophen ({APAP}) is one of the most intensively studied compounds that causes hepatotoxicity in the pericentral region of the liver lobules. However, spatio-temporal information on the distribution of {APAP}, its metabolites and {GSH} adducts in the liver tissue is not yet available. Here, we addressed the question, whether {APAP}-{GSH} adducts and {GSH} depletion show a zonated pattern and whether the distribution of {APAP} and its glucuronide as well as sulfate conjugates in liver lobules are zonated. For this purpose, a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging ({MALDI} {MSI}) technique was established, where the {MSI} images were superimposed onto {CYP2E1} immunostained tissue. A time-dependent analysis (5, 15, 30, 60, 120, 240, 480 min) after intraperitoneal administration of 300 mg/kg {APAP} and a dose-dependent analysis (56 up to 500 mg {APAP}/kg) at 30 min were performed. The results demonstrate that the {MALDI} {MSI} technique allows the assignment of compounds and their metabolites to specific lobular zones. {APAP}-{GSH} adducts and {GSH} depletion occurred predominantly in the {CYP2E1}-positive zone of the liver, although {GSH} also decreased in the periportal region. In contrast, the parent compound, {APAP} sulfate and {APAP} glucuronide did not show a zonated pattern and tissue concentrations showed a similar time course as the corresponding analyses were performed with blood from the portal and liver veins. In conclusion, the present study is in agreement with the concept that pericentral {CYPs} form {NAPQI} that in the same cell binds to and depletes {GSH} but a lower level of {GSH} adducts is also observed in the periportal region. The results also provide further evidence of the recently published concept of 'aggravated loss of clearance capacity' according to which also liver tissue that survives intoxication may transiently show decreased metabolic capacity.}

The proteolytic cleavage of {LTBP} is assumed to be the prerequisite for the activation of {TGF}-beta. We investigated the {mRNA} expression pattern of the three {LTBP} isoforms ({LTBP}-1, -2, -3) and the protein distribution of the components of the large latent {TGF}-beta complex, namely {LTBP}-1 and -2, latency-associated protein ({LAP}), and {TGF}-beta, in human liver using reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction ({RT}-{PCR}) and immunohistochemical alkaline phosphatase anti-alkaline phosphatase ({APAAP}) staining. Parts of explanted livers diagnosed as hepatitis B, hepatitis C, primary biliary cirrhosis ({PBC}), and primary sclerosing cholangitis ({PSC}) and normal liver tissue were examined. {LTBP} transcripts were detected in the same manner in all liver specimens. Interestingly, we found a new splice variant of {LTBP}-1 ({LTBP}-{1D}), in which the sequence coding for the proteinase-sensitive hinge region is deleted. The corresponding parts of the human {LTBP}-2 and {LTBP}-3 {cDNA} coding for the hinge region were sequenced and show neither similar proteinase cleavage sites nor deleted {cDNA} sequences. The proposed proteinase cleavage site of mouse {LTBP}-3 seems not to be conserved in the human {LTBP}-3 gene. By immunohistochemistry, {LTBP}-1, -2, and {LAP} were detectable in normal and diseased livers and showed a different staining pattern for both {LTBP} isoforms. By contrast, {TGF}-beta showed a spotted staining pattern in diseased livers only, predominantly in the area of parenchymal cells that are close to fibrotic tissue. This strongly suggests the release of active {TGF}-beta from preexisting latent complexes. The {LTBP}-{1D} splice variant, which is probably less sensitive against proteolytic degradation and therefore may protect {TGF}-beta from activation, may have importance for modulating the biological activity of {TGF}-beta in normal and diseased liver.}

abstract = {Since xenobiotics enter the organism via the liver, hepatocytes must cope with numerous perturbations, including modifications of proteins leading to endoplasmic reticulum stress ({ER}-stress). This triggers a signaling pathway termed unfolded protein response ({UPR}) that aims to restore homeostasis or to eliminate disturbed hepatocytes by apoptosis. In the present study, we used the well-established {CCl4} hepatotoxicity model in mice to address the questions whether {CCl4} induces {ER}-stress and, if so, whether the well-known {ER}-stress effector {CHOP} is responsible for {CCl4}-induced apoptosis. For this purpose, we treated mice with a high dose of {CCl4} injected i.p. and followed gene expression profile over time using Affymetrix gene array analysis. This time resolved gene expression analysis allowed the identification of gene clusters with overrepresented binding sites for the three most important {ER}-stress induced transcription factors, {CHOP}, {XBP1} and {ATF4}. Such result was confirmed by the demonstration of {CCl4}-induced {XBP1} splicing, upregulation of {CHOP} at {mRNA} and protein levels, and translocation of {CHOP} to the nucleus. Two observations indicated that {CHOP} may be responsible for {CCl4}-induced cell death: (1) Nuclear translocation of {CHOP} was exclusively observed in the pericentral fraction of hepatocytes that deteriorate in response to {CCl4} and (2) {CHOP}-regulated genes with previously reported pro-apoptotic function such as {GADD34}, {TRB3} and {ERO1L} were induced in the pericentral zone as well. Therefore, we compared {CCl4} induced hepatotoxicity in {CHOP} knockout versus wild-type mice. Surprisingly, genetic depletion of {CHOP} did not afford protection against {CCl4}-induced damage as evidenced by serum {GOT} and {GPT} as well as quantification of dead tissue areas. The negative result was obtained at several time points (8, 24 and 72 h) and different {CCl4} doses (1.6 and 0.132 g/kg). Overall, our results demonstrate that all branches of the {UPR} are activated in mouse liver upon {CCl4} treatment. However, {CHOP} does not play a critical role in {CCl4}-induced cell death and cannot be considered as a biomarker strictly linked to hepatotoxicity. The role of alternative {UPR} effectors such as {XBP1} remains to be investigated.}

abstract = {It is well known that isolation and cultivation of primary hepatocytes cause major gene expression alterations. In the present genome-wide, time-resolved study of cultivated human and mouse hepatocytes, we made the observation that expression changes in culture strongly resemble alterations in liver diseases. Hepatocytes of both species were cultivated in collagen sandwich and in monolayer conditions. Genome-wide data were also obtained from human {NAFLD}, cirrhosis, {HCC} and hepatitis B virus-infected tissue as well as mouse livers after partial hepatectomy, {CCl4} intoxication, obesity, {HCC} and {LPS}. A strong similarity between cultivation and disease-induced expression alterations was observed. For example, expression changes in hepatocytes induced by 1-day cultivation and 1-day {CCl4} exposure in vivo correlated with R = 0.615 (p \textless  0.001). Interspecies comparison identified predominantly similar responses in human and mouse hepatocytes but also a set of genes that responded differently. Unsupervised clustering of altered genes identified three main clusters: (1) downregulated genes corresponding to mature liver functions, (2) upregulation of an inflammation/{RNA} processing cluster and (3) upregulated migration/cell cycle-associated genes. Gene regulatory network analysis highlights overrepresented and deregulated {HNF4} and {CAR} (Cluster 1), Krüppel-like factors {MafF} and {ELK1} (Cluster 2) as well as {ETF} (Cluster 3) among the interspecies conserved key regulators of expression changes. Interventions ameliorating but not abrogating cultivation-induced responses include removal of non-parenchymal cells, generation of the hepatocytes' own matrix in spheroids, supplementation with bile salts and {siRNA}-mediated suppression of key transcription factors. In conclusion, this study shows that gene regulatory network alterations of cultivated hepatocytes resemble those of inflammatory liver diseases and should therefore be considered and exploited as disease models.}

abstract = {The hypoxia-inducible transcription factor 1 ({HIF}-1) has been shown to ameliorate different bacterial infections through enhancement of microbial killing. While the impact of {HIF}-1 on inflammatory diseases of the gut has been studied intensively, its function in bacterial infections of the intestine remains largely elusive. With the help of a publicly available gene expression data set, we could infer significant activation of the {HIF}-1 transcription factor after oral infection of mice with Salmonella Typhimurium. This prompted us to apply lineage-restricted deletion of the Hif1a locus in mice to examine cell type-specific functions of {HIF}-1 in this model. We show hypoxia-independent induction of {HIF}-1 activity upon Salmonella infection in the intestinal epithelium as well as in macrophages. Surprisingly, Hif1a deletion in intestinal epithelial cells impacted neither disease outcome nor inflammatory activity. The conditional knockout of Hif1a in myeloid cells enhanced the {mRNA} expression of the largely pro-inflammatory chemokine Cxcl2 , revealing a potentially inflammatory effect of {HIF}-1 deficiency in myeloid cells in the gut in vivo . Again, the disease outcome was not affected. In vitro {HIF}-1-deficient macrophages showed an overall impaired transcription of pro-inflammatory factors, however, Salmonella bypassed direct intracellular, bactericidal {HIF}-1-dependent mechanisms in a Salmonella pathogenicity island ({SPI})-2 independent manner. Taken together, our data suggest that {HIF}-1 in intestinal epithelial and myeloid cells is either dispensable or compensable in the immune defense against Salmonella Typhimurium.}

However, spatial transcriptomics ({ST}) profiling techniques lack single-cell resolution and require a combination with single-cell {RNA} sequencing ({scRNA}-seq) information to deconvolute the spatially indexed datasets. Leveraging the strengths of both data types, we developed {SPOTlight}, a computational tool that enables the integration of {ST} with {scRNA}-seq data to infer the location of cell types and states within a complex tissue. {SPOTlight} is centered around a seeded non-negative matrix factorization ({NMF}) regression, initialized using cell-type marker genes and non-negative least squares ({NNLS}) to subsequently deconvolute {ST} capture locations (spots). Simulating varying reference quantities and qualities, we confirmed high prediction accuracy also with shallowly sequenced or small-sized {scRNA}-seq reference datasets. {SPOTlight} deconvolution of the mouse brain correctly mapped subtle neuronal cell states of the cortical layers and the defined architecture of the hippocampus. In human pancreatic cancer, we successfully segmented patient sections and further fine-mapped normal and neoplastic cell states. Trained on an external single-cell pancreatic tumor references, we further charted the localization of clinical-relevant and tumor-specific immune cell states, an illustrative example of its flexible application spectrum and future potential in digital pathology. \copyright The Author(s) 2021.

abstract = {Acute liver damage causes hepatocyte stress and death, but in chronic liver disease impaired hepatocyte regeneration and immune cell infiltration prevents recovery. While the roles of both impaired liver regeneration and immune infiltration have been studied extensively in chronic liver diseases, the differential contribution of these factors is difficult to assess. We combined single-cell {RNA}-seq data from healthy livers and peripheral immune cells to measure cell proportions in chronic liver diseases. Using bulk {RNA}-seq data from patients with early alcohol-associated hepatitis ({EAH}), severe {AH} ({sAH}), Hepatitis C ({HCV}), {HCV} with cirrhosis, and non-alcohol-associated fatty liver disease ({NAFLD}), we performed gene deconvolution to predict the contribution of different cell types in each disease. Patients with {sAH} had the greatest change in cell composition, with increases in both periportal hepatocytes and cholangiocyte populations. Interestingly, while central vein hepatocytes were decreased, central vein endothelial cells were expanded. Endothelial cells are thought to regulate liver regeneration through {WNT} signaling. {WNT2}, important in central vein hepatocyte development, was down in {sAH}, while multiple other {WNTs} and {WNT} receptors were upregulated. Immunohistochemistry revealed upregulation of {FZD6}, a noncanonical {WNT} receptor, in hepatocytes in {sAH}. Immune cell populations also differed in disease. In {sAH}, a specific group of inflammatory macrophages was increased and distinct from the macrophage population in patients with {HCV}. Network and correlation analyses revealed that changes in the cell types in the liver were highly correlated with clinical liver function tests. In conclusion, these results identify distinct changes in the liver cell populations in chronic liver disease and illustrate the power of utilizing single-cell {RNA}-seq data from a limited number of samples in understanding multiple different diseases.

abstract = {Background Transcriptomic studies have contributed to fundamental knowledge of myocardial remodeling in human heart failure ({HF}). However, the key {HF} genes reported are often inconsistent between studies, and systematic efforts to integrate evidence from multiple patient cohorts are lacking. Here, we aimed to provide a framework for comprehensive comparison and analysis of publicly available data sets resulting in an unbiased consensus transcriptional signature of human end-stage {HF}. Methods and Results We curated and uniformly processed 16 public transcriptomic studies of left ventricular samples from 263 healthy and 653 failing human hearts. First, we evaluated the degree of consistency between studies by using linear classifiers and overrepresentation analysis. Then, we meta-analyzed the deregulation of 14 041 genes to extract a consensus signature of {HF}. Finally, to functionally characterize this signature, we estimated the activities of 343 transcription factors, 14 signaling pathways, and 182 micro {RNAs}, as well as the enrichment of 5998 biological processes. Machine learning approaches revealed conserved disease patterns across all studies independent of technical differences. These consistent molecular changes were prioritized with a meta-analysis, functionally characterized and validated on external data. We provide all results in a free public resource (https://saezlab.shinyapps.io/reheat/) and exemplified usage by deciphering fetal gene reprogramming and tracing the potential myocardial origin of the plasma proteome markers in patients with {HF}. Conclusions Even though technical and sampling variability confound the identification of differentially expressed genes in individual studies, we demonstrated that coordinated molecular responses during end-stage {HF} are conserved. The presented resource is crucial to complement findings in independent studies and decipher fundamental changes in failing myocardium.}

abstract = {Background: Systemic Lupus Erythematosus ({SLE}) is a systemic autoimmune disease with diverse clinical manifestations. Although most of the {SLE}-associated loci are located in regulatory regions, there is a lack of global information about transcription factor ({TFs}) activities, the mode of regulation of the {TFs}, or the cell or sample-specific regulatory circuits. The aim of this work is to decipher {TFs} implicated in {SLE}. Methods: In order to decipher regulatory mechanisms in {SLE}, we have inferred {TF} activities from transcriptomic data for almost all human {TFs}, defined clusters of {SLE} patients based on the estimated {TF} activities and analyzed the differential activity patterns among {SLE} and healthy samples in two different cohorts. The Transcription Factor activity matrix was used to stratify {SLE} patients and define sets of {TFs} with statistically significant differential activity among the disease and control samples. Results: {TF} activities were able to identify two main subgroups of patients characterized by distinct neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio ({NLR}), with consistent patterns in two independent datasets\textemdashone from pediatric patients and other from adults. Furthermore, after contrasting all subgroups of patients and controls, we obtained a significant and robust list of 14 {TFs} implicated in the dysregulation of {SLE} by different mechanisms and pathways. Among them, well-known regulators of {SLE}, such as {STAT} or {IRF}, were found, but others suggest new pathways that might have important roles in {SLE}. Conclusions: These results provide a foundation to comprehend the regulatory mechanism underlying {SLE} and the established regulatory factors behind {SLE} heterogeneity that could be potential therapeutic targets.}
